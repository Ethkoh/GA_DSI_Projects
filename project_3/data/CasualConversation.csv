Monthly Meta is back - [follow the collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/collection/20266a90-78bb-4216-b643-b4e99aafb4bb) to get notified when a new one is made! This post will be created on the 1st of every month.

We'd like to keep up-to-date on current thoughts about the subreddit. Here's a few talking points of interest:

* critique or praise the sub
* critique or praise the mods
* critique or praise the community
* address the community
* ideas for the sub
* thoughts on the current trend of posts
* thoughts on recent subreddit projects
* or anything you can think of

We'll also use this time to give updates on what's been happening on the subreddit within the past month.

**Chat Posts**

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/g6vi2s/rcasualconversation\_lounge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/g6vi2s/rcasualconversation_lounge/) 

We tested out making a lounge chat. You all seemed to really like it. A bit chaotic with how fast the chat goes. With a few troublemakers posting lewd or spammy stuff, other than that, ya'll seemed to dig it. We'll probably keep doing them more in the future! 

**Photoshop Contest**

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/g3bp0k/isolate\_with\_us\_photoshop\_contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/g3bp0k/isolate_with_us_photoshop_contest/)

New mod u/silverning tried out hosting a competition. It went ok but we didn't get as many submission as we would like. We do plan on doing them more in the future and hope more people participate. 

**User Flairs**

We added 8 new user flairs. These ones have emojis in them and you can add you own text to them too. Check out the sidebar to give yourself one of the new flairs.

**Rate Your Day + Chat**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/collection/117553b0-f466-4db2-b9cc-531d0afb659f](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/collection/117553b0-f466-4db2-b9cc-531d0afb659f)

During this month, we are going to combine our previous rate your day posts with the chat posts. Try to get a 2 for one of letting you rate your day/5 and having a lounge'ish chat. We'll start that this coming Sunday - keep an eye out for them!

&amp;#x200B;

I think that about sums up all the things we did this past month. Let us know what you think about all this in the comments below!

Thanks and have a good day!

,CasualConversation,"For context I’m visually impaired. I do have a guide dog but will occasionally use my white cane(went to Disneyland and put my guide dog in the air conditioned kennel).

I’m one of those people that name everything. My phone has a name and so does my watch. Of course my canes have names as well. My straight cane is Bob and my fold up cane is Stuart- they are my minions they do all the work I get all the glory...plus no one understood why I wanted to name my fold up cane Dr Leo Marvin(if you get it extra points!).

Anyway my youngest niece only knows my canes by the names I’ve given them.

The teacher apparently showed the class a picture of a blind person using a cane and my niece yelled at the top of her lungs “MY AUNT HAS A BOB TOO!” My sister in law called me to tell me this story and to let me know she had to explain to the teacher and the class that I named my cane Bob.

,CasualConversation,"Hi, guys!
Thank-you for choosing to read this random rant 💜

Okay, so I'm this conservative and awkward girl when it comes to friendships, whether it be new or old. I'd rather make friends with animals than humans. It takes me really long to develop a certain level of friendship with people. So, my way of making friends with someone is me being really, genuinely, nice to them 🤷

I was attending this dance practice meet with this community of people who I've been familiar with for a while now.

Fast forward, we were on our first break after hours of practice, and we were in a small shop to buy food and refreshments. There was a girl who wanted to buy a certain drink, but had forgotten to bring her wallet, so I bought her one. And went on to ask other girls whether they wanted anything to drink. They didn't seem to hear me. So, I asked them again after a while (natural, right?).

They didn't hear me again, but this time there was this other girl who was observing me and she goes ""Why are you being so sweet? They can buy the drinks if they want to 😅"" and seemed to be really weirded out by me being sweet (???). So I told her that I'm asking because they're my friends and that I would buy her one too, if she wanted. And then she seemed to make fun of me for being nice?

After this, I've stopped wanting to being nice. People like her really spoil the happiness you get when you're sweet to someone :/

,CasualConversation,"Hi everyone! I hope you are doing well :)

Okay so I have something on my mind. What do I do when I remember embarrassing things? 
Like socially awkward behaviors form when I was a teen? The time I accidently implied to a teacher that he was old? The time my phrasing made me sound like I was talking about my boyfriend's genitalia to his mother?
You know, the kind of things you'd rather forget.
How do you deal with that?

My current way of dealing with it is singing until I forget, it kind of works, I forget for a while, then : BAM! Remember that time you said this thing to someone who probably doesn't remember? Well they do! And they are judging you right now!

I'm bad at confronting uncomfortable thoughts, I actually have a desorder with this particular symptom. People who have that desorder will avoid uncomfortable feelings at all costs. I've had therapy about that, and my life is better. So I'm not sure if my issue dealing with awkward memories is specific to my history, and the fact I never comfronted them for 20 years, or if it happens to everyone. Do you also experience that?

I had an idea how to exorcise myself of these thoughts, and take them out of my head. I thought I could make comics, called something like ""awkward moments"" or ""times I f*cked up"" and just draw those events. Take time to dive in them, and maybe tame them, so that they don't have the power to make me feel bad.

I would also love to hear about your awkward moments, however small they are! I feel like we tend to make mountains out of small things, maybe your mountains are my hills, and my mountains are your hills. Sharing would be fun!

It's mostly that I have a hobby which I enjoy and want to get really better at, or even a hobby that I'm doing for a long time already, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and / or underwhelmed what I should do about it. And when i get to it motivated and start doing it it frustrates me pretty fast. Probably because I got no plan how to get better or what to do.

But when I do a plan and I follow it, which gives me a good direction, I don't feel like im improving in the long run. And then it falls apart and I'm falling back to doing just something or mostly nothing regarding that hobby.

Another problem is, that I get into stuff like really easily and I want to learn it. Then I'm informing myself how to do it forever instead of just doing it. Maybe because I what to find the best possible way to learn it.

Then you see all the people on social media who are just like so much better st you (in a specific skill) and you start to imagine the amount of work they put in and I get frustrated that I didn't put in the work all the last years. But I don't start putting in the work.

Hobbies affected for those that are interested: Music: mostly Drumming, Music making, playing the piano
Sports: Calisthenics, Bouldering, (wanted to do tricking forever)
IT (also job): programming, networks, cyber security

TL;DR I'm struggling with my self worth and want to change that.

I pretty sure there are some people that feel the same, how do you deal with it? 

Did someone overcome this habits / patterns? What did you do about it?

Does someone have any tips how I could approach to change this?

Are you struggling with a different problem with the things you want to do? What is hindering you to do your hobby / get better at it?

I hope this is somehow understandable and not to big of a mess. Sorry for the long text, maybe it's to deep for this sub. Should i post it elsewhere?

,CasualConversation,"TL;DR 
I decided to learn ukulele! I’m developing old hobbies and learning new ones with my quarantine time. Is there something you want to learn? What is holding you back at the moment??

I was always a band geek. My music teacher in 4th grade was amazing and then my music teacher in 5-12th grade was phenomenal. At the end of 3rd grade I was in the process of being removed from my mothers care and adopted by my grandparents. It was a stressful and a strange time for me. Full of shit I didn’t understand. I fell into music kind of as an escape and therapy. Band was my favorite class of the day and was typically a soothing hour for me. A wonderful follow up to the stress of Chemistry. 

Anyways, I know(knew) how to read sheet music. I know how to recreate what someone composed however I’ve never written a song of my own. So for the past two years with writing music at the forefront of my mind, I’ve been trying to decide what instrument I wanted to learn. I recently decided I was going to order a ukulele! I ordered it and now it’s here! I am pretty excited to start writing my own music. 

If I wasn’t under a stay-at-home order, I am not sure if I would have made a decision and took the leap. As much as I thought I would hate it, I’ve come to realize that this is my normal life anyways. I go shopping once a week instead of every three days now, and I explore my hobbies more. I have started exploring NEW hobbies. I am happy with the way I’ve decided to spend my time during this pandemic.

I had to finish my 1st semester of my certificate program online, couldnt really make plans to go out &amp; my gym shut down... I was basically stuck at home. I am the type of person who likes to be out and about, whether it be out with friends or alone, so this was a big adjustment. 

I just wanted to say im thankful for the last two months. I began to appreciate my own solitude and worry about me. Right now I am a 23 y/o female who is unemployed, lives at home, but still in school, and honestly im not mad at my situation. These past two months I have done things I wouldnt have done prior to this time like:

1) I've read 3 books in their entirety within a month.... This may not be a big deal but considering that I only read a total of 2 books in 2019, this is a HUGE improvement lol. 

2)I learned to skateboard and found a fun new hobby (Kind obsessed lmao) 

3) Ive actually cut down on smoking weed... which is ironic since I have more time to do it now, but I feel good 

4) Staying up late with no worries of the next morning... Sleeping in &amp; NO ALARM CLOCK!

5) Done WAY more self-reflection in order to help me heal and grow 

6) Go on walks almost everyday with my music. This is my favourite thing to do!!! I walk and listen to albums. I have so much fun doing this cause sometimes I feel I dont really appreciate the artist and their creation. My walks have made me realize how much I really love music and how lost I would be without it. My walks are when I can just think about anything or feel whatever.. sometimes if im having a bad day I will even cry and it sounds so bizarre but its just a cathartic feeling 

Sometimes I do feel useless as shit! Im fkn 23 I should be waking up at 8am attending zoom meetings with employers or working from home or working on becoming an entrepreneur to keep up in todays gig economy. But at the same time I think about it and go ""When will I ever get time like this again?"". Im learning to not beat myself up on things I cant control and to also just take a step back. I think we get sooo caught up in comparing our lives to each other that we feel guilty for doing nothing. Im not saying drop your priorities, but during such a unique time dont feel bad for taking it easy. Im learning alot about myself and the type of person I want to become. I still got alot of shit to work on but I feel like im really improving and liking what im becoming. So fuck feeling unproductive or useless or worthless during such a WEIRD AND UNEXPECTED time. If you wanna lay in bed all day do it! Eat junk food? go for it. Skip a home workout cause you just dont want too, fuck it.

It was almost like I was years ahead in my life and I was happy, I was married, I had my career, like things just worked out? It just felt so real and idk? Its kinda like everything has been going wrong. I lost my job, my dad is sick with the virus and my boyfriend is away. And then this one dream just changed my mood?

,CasualConversation,"So this was about 3 or so years ago.

My family went on vacation to the Upper Peninsula. It had been awhile since we went camping, so I was pretty excited. There’s a lot of cool sights to see, trails to hike, and places to visit.

My dad and I ended up going out on our own one day. We planned to go to a museum that was close to a harbor, but the museum was closed. We decided to just walk around the docks of the harbor and enjoy the scenery.

We were walking down a boardwalk, and a duck flies over and lands in the water next to us. My dad and I stop to admire it.

A few seconds in and the duck proceeds to take a nasty shit in the water. 

“Okay that was a little gross, but he’s still cute”

The duck turns around and starts eating it’s shit.

“Alright I think we can move on now”

Sometime in my teenage years after lots of therapy, it was decided that it would probably be best to put me on antidepressants. They targeted both the morbid depression and the terrible anxiety I was experiencing.  I've tried to get off of them a few times, but I always had a lot of difficulty because I wasn't in a stable situation and I wasn't physically healthy, so withdrawal symptoms from medicine were too much for my body to handle. 


Well, about five months ago I decided it was /really/ time. I weened off, and I've been off of them for about four months now.  I know that seems like awhile ago, but I think the length of time I've been off them is important. It means they're fully out of my system, and it also feels like this might be it. I don't think I'll need them anymore. 

 I have had some of the hardest months of my life recently. Filled with people deaths, pet deaths, career changes, financial uncertainties, and all other sorts of bad luck (not even counting the international tragedies that we're all facing).  During this, I haven't felt nearly as depressed or anxious as I had when I began the medicines.  I'm coping well.  I can recognize the difference between just being sad because of a situation, and me slipping into a depressive episode. And for the first time in my life I can effectively pull myself out of the episodes, or at the very least not let them suck me completely under. 


 I haven't felt suicidal at all, not even when I was weening off the meds (a symptom I'd experienced before when trying to stop them in the past). 


I really hope I'm right and I don't ever have to be on them again.  I have physical things to deal with that mean I'll be on some type of medicine for the rest of my life, but the less medicine I have to take the better.  They were good for my brain at the time. They evened my thoughts out and made life liveable during a time that I didn't want to live.  They definitely saved me.  If I do have to go back on them at some point, for any reason, then that's okay.  I understand our mental health changes throughout our lives, and sometimes medicine is needed for mental ailments just like for physical ailments.  But for now, I don't need it.

I&amp;#39;ve used a tiny fan heater for about 5 years to heat my office, before that i just dressed as watm as i could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after 10 years, and my parents fightung the insurance company, we had our ducted heating replaced, and two more reverse cycle aircons put in downstairs, giving us heat in the whole house again! It&amp;#39;s so nice to be warm again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have more that needs fixing, like our bathroom that has mold all through the walls (no wonder i get such bad hayfever in autumn/spring, that sometimes results in pneumonia!), but this is such a good step forward. We can finally be warm again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do understand what would compell someone to not let thier feels out, there&amp;#39;s always the fear that you&amp;#39;ll be judged, that your feelings are invalid, or you don&amp;#39;t think you can trust anyone. Those are all valid reasons, and I do try to be available for people to let it all out if they decide to.&lt;/p&gt;

Then in 2010 they moved new cartoon episodes to prime time, but only aired reruns on Saturday mornings which were dropped in 2014, when they gave all their cartoons away to Disney XD for one-week timed exclusivity. Then in 2016, they started airing their own cartoons in prime time only with no reruns. Then around 2017 they started only having weekend mornings for both new episodes and reruns of cartoons. In 2018, they started doing weekday afternoon new episodes and reruns for cartoons, but that did not last long at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They usually only keep a cartoon airing new episodes in prime time for about half of the first season, and then it gets shafted, with no rerun time slots. Why do they shaft their cartoons like this?&lt;/p&gt;

I was (and still am) super grateful for the opportunity and accepted the offer.

I knew I’d have to get an apartment and find a car on my own with the small savings I had.

Cut to today. I’ve been searching for a car and talking it over with my parents, when my grandpa (who has graciously let my family move in with him for the past 10 years) came to sit with us. The room is quiet and he asks “do you want to buy my car?”. I think he’s joking, so I humor him to say “how much?”. I can’t hear his reply so I ask him again. He says “nothing”. I laugh. And I stare at him. And I don’t know what to say. He tells me I’d have to check the tires and the oil, but I can take it for a test drive tomorrow”. After I ask him again if he’s serious, he jokes “grandma said that she wanted you to have it”.

,CasualConversation,"I have a problem dwelling on embarrassing and scary memories. Even years later, after everything is OK and there's nothing to worry about, it can be hard to move on from! But I've found a way to cope: retell the memory from a funny perspective, as if you were on stand up comedy. Sharing it with friends helps me move on from it. And they laugh because it's funny!

For example: once I was pulled over out of state on a business trip. Rental car and all. 11pm at night. He turned his lights on behind me. I was in the turning lane in active traffic, turn signal on and everything. I intended on turning and pulling into a gas station right on the corner - you know, since we're in the middle of an intersection. But once that light turned green and I started to drive, I heard the cop hitting the back of my car and yelling at me! He was outside my car! I told him where I was going and did so, he spent 5 minutes yelling about why I need to stop for cops, told me to turn my headlights on (LOL! Rental car didn't have automatic lights) ran my DL and told me to go home. No fine no ticket. But you better believe I was TERRIFIED!! So that story lurked in my head for *months* and I kept dwelling on it until I finally started to tell it like a funny story. ""I ever tell you about the time I drove off on a cop? Out of state?? Oh man you wouldn't believe this--""

Just yesterday I was stupid and took too hot of a bath for too long. Felt dizzy and light headed. Went to my kitchen to get a cup of water with the intention of crashing on the couch and rehydrating. Pouring water I suddenly felt like blood was rushing out of my head. Oh no! Well, next thing I remember I'm staring at the underside of the kitchen table. I was only out for a minute, but I had no memory of falling OR hitting my head since I still have a big sore bump I'm nursing, ugh. So it was scary and I panicked a bit, but after checking myself out and ruling out any major medical emergency (no blood, no blurry vision, no headache, feeling better today) I've now begun sharing this story to all my friends. ""So I made out with the floor yesterday. Mistakes were made"" They're laughing, and I'm laughing! And I already feel better about it. My goal is to move on from this little embarrassing mishap with no more than a bump on the head and a funny story - NOT a scary situation that I need to incessantly dwell on!!

Naturally if it's something serious it's best to not make fun of it. But in almost all cases I dwell on things in the past that are perfectly OK now. Why worry about things that are said and done? Humor is my coping mechanism I guess. Just wanted to share! Anyone else do the same or want to share their own embarrassing moments turned funny stories?

Edit: those worried about my health, please don't worry guys I'm okay! I did a really stupid thing yesterday and suffered for it. I have no history of fainting but this had a legit cause. Don't overheat yourself! Stay hydrated! And maybe... if you feel faint... don't go into a kitchen with granite counters and stone tile.

Even years later, after everything is OK and there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about, it can be hard to move on from! But I&amp;#39;ve found a way to cope: retell the memory from a funny perspective, as if you were on stand up comedy. Sharing it with friends helps me move on from it. And they laugh because it&amp;#39;s funny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: once I was pulled over out of state on a business trip. Rental car and all. 11pm at night. He turned his lights on behind me. I was in the turning lane in active traffic, turn signal on and everything. I intended on turning and pulling into a gas station right on the corner - you know, since we&amp;#39;re in the middle of an intersection. But once that light turned green and I started to drive, I heard the cop hitting the back of my car and yelling at me! He was outside my car! I told him where I was going and did so, he spent 5 minutes yelling about why I need to stop for cops, told me to turn my headlights on (LOL! Rental car didn&amp;#39;t have automatic lights) ran my DL and told me to go home. No fine no ticket. But you better believe I was TERRIFIED!! So that story lurked in my head for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; and I kept dwelling on it until I finally started to tell it like a funny story. &amp;quot;I ever tell you about the time I drove off on a cop? Out of state?? Oh man you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe this--&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday I was stupid and took too hot of a bath for too long. Felt dizzy and light headed. Went to my kitchen to get a cup of water with the intention of crashing on the couch and rehydrating. Pouring water I suddenly felt like blood was rushing out of my head. Oh no! Well, next thing I remember I&amp;#39;m staring at the underside of the kitchen table. I was only out for a minute, but I had no memory of falling OR hitting my head since I still have a big sore bump I&amp;#39;m nursing, ugh. So it was scary and I panicked a bit, but after checking myself out and ruling out any major medical emergency (no blood, no blurry vision, no headache, feeling better today) I&amp;#39;ve now begun sharing this story to all my friends. &amp;quot;So I made out with the floor yesterday. Mistakes were made&amp;quot; They&amp;#39;re laughing, and I&amp;#39;m laughing! And I already feel better about it. My goal is to move on from this little embarrassing mishap with no more than a bump on the head and a funny story - NOT a scary situation that I need to incessantly dwell on!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally if it&amp;#39;s something serious it&amp;#39;s best to not make fun of it. But in almost all cases I dwell on things in the past that are perfectly OK now. Why worry about things that are said and done? Humor is my coping mechanism I guess. Just wanted to share! Anyone else do the same or want to share their own embarrassing moments turned funny stories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: those worried about my health, please don&amp;#39;t worry guys I&amp;#39;m okay! I did a really stupid thing yesterday and suffered for it. I have no history of fainting but this had a legit cause. Don&amp;#39;t overheat yourself! Stay hydrated! And maybe... if you feel faint... don&amp;#39;t go into a kitchen with granite counters and stone tile. Carpet would&amp;#39;ve been more comfortable 🤦‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"My mom is 65. She dealt with computers when she was working, but the she quit her job to look after me and my brother while we were growing up.

Anyone that is above thirty will remember that the past 25-30 years have been wild when it comes to technology: we made huge strides, we went from cordless phones becoming largely available, to the Internet becoming popular, to many people not even using a landline anymore, because we have a smartphone and the entire Internet in our pocket, and everything that happened in between.

So yeah, she had not really kept up with everything that happened, learning only the very basics that allowed her to make and receive calls, and exchange messages through WhatsApp. Smartphone 101, you could say. 

""The Internet"" used to be, and largely still is, a mystery to her, and she was always a very passive part of it, only using a tiny tiny fraction of it and not interacting with anything besides, you know, things like the ""play"" button on YouTube.

Recently, though, I could tell from her questions that she wanted to learn more. She didn't tell me directly, but I know her, and it became apparent.

So I sat down with her and taught her a few more things, being careful not to give her more than she can chew, so to speak.

She is a creative individual and likes to crochet, among other things, so the content she's interested in are mainly YouTube videos showing cool projects.

In a few short days she learned how to follow the channels she's interested in, how to get notifications from them, how to see the list of the channels she's subscribed to, and that the blue dot means that the channel has posted something new since the last time she visited.

Today we made another step forward, and she learned how to add clips she likes to playlists of her own.

Now, thanks to a glitch in Google I recently got a couple of notifications from a channel she subscribed to. I don't really know why it happened, I set the recovery email address to mine, and maybe it's because of that, maybe it's intended and documented behavior. I don't know. I'll figure it out, but that's not important right now.

Well, right this morning I got an email saying ""&lt;channel name&gt; has replied to your comment!"".

I opened it up and saw that it contained both the reply and her original message. Since it was a public reply to a public comment on a public video on a public channel on a public website, I figured it was okay to read.

So I did. And it was heartwarming.

It was like reading the words of and excited little girl, thanking the person behind this channel for her work and telling her everything about how she just ordered all the threads to crochet a sweater and that she couldn't wait to get them and jump right in.

And this person has been super nice in her reply, thanking her back and saying how cool it is when you make something with your hands.
My mother is good at crocheting and also very good at sewing and neither of those are things she picked up recently; in fact, she's been doing both for as long as I can remember.

So I thought: ""well, this surely is old hat to her"". Boy, was I wrong. I mean, crocheting *is* something she's done many times before, but something about commenting on the Internet made it clear how passionate she is. She would never show this much excitement in person, not even to me even though I do whatever I can in order to encourage her to pursue her interests. So this whole thing has been like a little window opening on what's going on inside her head, and I can't tell you how grateful I am that I got to witness it.

I'm now thinking of shooting a private message to the woman behind this channel to thank her and tell her a little about my mom, I think she will appreciate it.

Teaching her takes time, but I learned how to do it. I always make sure to make her do the thing she wants to learn on the phone herself, and then have her repeat it a couple of times more. Then maybe the next time I will ask her if she wants to show me how she would do the thing, and go over it once more if need be. If it's involved, I'll encourage her to take notes, and that in due time, doing it over and over, she'll memorize it.

It helps that I'm a stupidly patient guy.

And after all, I always try to keep in mind that she had to teach me how to operate a spoon back then, so it's okay if she doesn't get it right away :)

This more than made up for however much time I spent teaching her. It really did.

It may not seem that big of a deal to you guys, but seeing her going from being a passive user of the Internet to contributing a comment on a channel she loves really marks a new beginning.

It's interesting to teach her, because it helps me to digest things and make them as simple as I possibly can, which is particularly useful as a software developer. She has a hard time getting to grips with the abstractions every piece of software presents her with, but slowly I managed to get her to recognize common UI elements and the functions associated with them. We're not quite there yet, but at some point we will.

This process also delivers some ""aww"" moments when I watch her try to wrap her head around an abstraction (like telling her that folders on a computer are no different than the organizers she used in the office back when she worked).

Just yesterday I also made her her own PayPal account, to make her less scared of using her credit card to buy the things she wants. I don't expect she will be able to use it, I know she'll give me a call, and that's okay. In fact, I look forward to it.

I just hope people will always be nice to her on the Internet, I know that she would be really hurt if someone was rude in a reply to a comment of hers. However, the little communities around the sort of channel she follows are mostly made of like-minded women, young and older, and I have faith that they will behave.

That's it.

I wanted to share this, and encourage whoever is in a similar situation to be patient with their older parents. Some refuse to learn (my dad being a prime example, saying ""I'm too old for this""), others *want* to learn but are scared of even the tiniest of things that we, who are young enough to have grown up keeping the pace with technology, regard as obvious.

There is no cap for C grades, you just need to get above 40 percent and you can get a C. Anything below that is a D or F.   

There's usually around 300 students in the class, there are 3 exams: 2 midterms worth 25 percent each, and a final worth 50 percent of the grade. No makeup for missed exams. It's a weeder class, so all of the students are motivated to do well in order to preserve their Gpa in the major. Typically the exams are half multiple choice (with 5 answer choices), half free response with strict time limit of 40 minutes for a midterm and 2 hours for the final. 

To earn an A- you would have to have a raw score better than 92 percent of the students in the class (Top 24) , for an A better than 96 percent (Top 12) and for a B better than 70 percent (Top 90), etc. The professor posts a bunch of practice tests, some powerpoint slides / recorded lecture, weekly problem sets, and you can get help from the Ta's if need be every week.

It's like auto browsing reddit while only being partly in control but the bottom line is that I'm pretty stoked to have found it and it's great to look at while listening to podcasts.

I wanted to tell someone about this who might appreciate it and since people in this subreddit have always been so nice to everybody this seemed like the idel place.

I've lived alone in the same studio apartment (major New England city) for 20+ years with each day more or less like the one before until a couple of months ago when I got a phone call from my sister who lives in another state. Our mother had passed away a few weeks before, left $7,000.00 and since she and my brother are well off (and I'm doing okay on a fixed income) they agreed to offer it to me (I said ""thank you""). My sister suggested sending $500.00 checks to me to spend on whatever I wanted (she's sent 3 so far) and I always wanted a smart 4K tv while still being grateful for the still used 33"" 780 HD tv that had new life breathed into when I bought a firestick a few months ago (speaking into that remote is pretty cool).

So, like most people, I'm spending more time at home but unlike most people the quality of my homelife has improved by leaps and bounds over the last few weeks as assorted amazon packages have arrived with contents chosen to turn my small apartment into the techno/geek cave I always dreamed of (from time to time).

The screensaver picture changes every 5 seconds and it's almost hypnotising. Definitely the best ninety-nine cents I've ever spent. 

Me: 62 years young (I live like a college student who never goes to class) pot smoking former artist (no longer have the compulsion to draw so I haven't in years), regular internet surfer who spends enough time on reddit to feel the spirit time with Netflix and Prime subscriptions that get a lot of use.

Maybe it's a combination of the imposed isolation but I've writing more and posting thoughts (reviews lately) on line and since I've always like getting mail feel free to write if you have any questions about the rest of the stuff I bought or what it's like to be this old (had I known I'd be around this long I'd have exercised more) but at least I'm in relatively good health and with no chronic complaints.

I've been on reddit for about a decade (I'm guessing) and think this is my 3rd account (I was off totally for a while but now I'm back daily and AND for the first time ever, last week, bought reddit gold-yep, I joined the lounge too).

Save It For The Show was my favorite podcast for the better part of decade and when it ended a couple of years ago I couldn't bring myself to listen to the last episode of a show that I had looked forward to each week for so many years while developing a internet friendship with one of the hosts that continues to this day (shout out to Dan Fields).

The grief ran deep but I knew that one day it would ebb and I would finally catch up. That day was today. I listened to the last 3 episodes (starting with the most recent and unexpected Corona 2020 podcast that just came out) and smiled at my shout out on 2 of them. Each one was great in its own way (I wrote Dan and told him). 

Newly flush with cash one personal change is that I no longer have to mentally do the math to see if I can afford something fun in the ten to twenty dollar range on woot! A few days ago a bought a mouse pad that I saw in a woot! email that I never knew existed.

It's 33""x11"", usb powered  and the edge lights up with 12 different settings. Best mouse pad ever.

Anybody else had any unexpected good news lately?

,CasualConversation,"My Mom has been in a several year long battle with depression and her health has MAJORLY deteriorated through out the ordeal. She had been talking to doctors, consulting experts, and trying everything we could think of to get back on top of things. It was looking like she'd be spending the rest of her life bedridden.

Until, the other day, she decided to wean herself off of her antidepressants to see if they were potentially the cause of her physical problems.

She was right.

So far she's about 3 weeks into lowering her dose in an effort to eventually be off of them. And in that time, she's been walking around again, getting back into her hobbies, touring a new house she's planning to move into, and playing with my little siblings.

Not only that, but I called her today to wish her a happy mother's day, and I started crying because the old timbre in her voice was there. It felt like hearing my mom's voice for the first time in years. I couldn't believe it. Her voice has the power it used to, she's quick and witty again just like I remember her, and she's happy and excited for her future.

Over the course of a few weeks, she's gone from accepting that she's going to spend the rest of her life in a bed, only able to offer ""hang out in bed with mom"" time to her kids, to having the strong, smart, witty, and active woman she was, nearly within reach.

I'm really hopeful that this continues, because I'm more excited than words can describe that my mom is getting her life back!

Happy mother's day to you all! Call your mom's and tell them you love them!

,CasualConversation,"On Instagram I stalked thru the followers of the developer of some thing I played online when I was young, basically just a stroll through nostalgia. Checked thru the profiles to see if any of them were big, I just figured it would be funny if any of them were. I saw one of them was being followed by a meme page I follow, and it just seemed like such a weird coincidence, I had to follow this person. She followed me back, started liking my posts, I started liking her posts, eventually responded to something she said on her story, asked her if I could randomly send her memes, we agreed and began randomly sending each other memes, realized just how ridiculously much we had in common with these memes and specific subjects, memes turned into conversations (not that the memes went away of course, we got to know more and more about each other. We've been spending like 3 hours a day messaging each other, and I've told her things I've spent so much of my life only daydreaming about being able to tell people, and I think she's had similar experience telling me about things. She lives halfway across the planet and we don't have any mutual acquaintances. We've both fantasized about how nice it'd be if we met each other irl but that might not ever happen.

I always thought the internet was a not so great place to open up about your emotions and feeling but i guess i was wrong, I'm trying to find more hobbies in my free time, I'm learning more and more about fixing different kinds of electronics, And trying to squeeze in some time to learn a bit of greek on duolingo before the bird either kills me because i missed like 10 days since i downloaded the app or i just lose all interests and get to greece and making it harder for myself till i get proper teaching, I might miss a year which i'm really bummed about but its all fine because i made a 2 friends while going their which i still talk to this day with since my trip in january, Very nice country and people too.

Well for my mental being, Its getting better, I'm feeling more happy since i'm progressing through everything and making dreams and goals for myself to take on !.

I'm starting to realize that i'm talking to myself alot, In the past couple of years, While gaming, studying, Anything, Honestly talking to myself makes me feel better, i talk to myself like there is someone next to me or like im recording my video, i don't know if its something i should worry about but my parents said its all fine. So yeah...

I have to currently go to sleep since my tutor is coming at 12pm tomorrow, i studied at the morning, Then my arab tutor came and then i continued.

Honestly 9th grade is so over rated in syria, everyone tells me or us that its so hard but no actually, it might be because i'm in a private school ? I really don't know actually... but i have 7 subjects (Math, Science,religion,French, arabic, english and social studies which are history geography and national education) so i finished 4 of them and still got 41 days to go, Yay... i guess. Exams are on the door, Social studies is he hardest so far, Since i'm now repeating math and science and arabic and History and geography and i don't study english because its to easy for me.

I get bullied for my HEAVY british accent yet i'm practicing normal American Accent so i can be more understandble for Non native english speakers. Because sometimes i'm not audible or they cant understand me.

I'm laying in bed at 3:50 am right now, listening to I'm Yours by Jason Mraz trying to stay afloat.

I'm in my last year of high school, and my depression has been hitting hard the last few days.

Something that always helps me feel better is hearing what makes people happy - whether it be spending time with a certain person, the demeanor of their pets, being in a place special to them, an occasion, anything. I call memories like these Patronus Memories(since they're what you need to conjure a Patronus in Harry Potter) and reading some people's right now would really help.

I'll start -
One of my favourite memories is a day that I spent in San Francisco with my best friend. We missed the train, got breakfast, ran to catch the next one, walked miles to get ice cream, ate it in the sunset, walked back, and took the train home. We reached back at 10:30pm.

I'm sorry, I can't gather my thoughts enough to provide more details but just the thought of the memory makes me feel a little better inside.

,CasualConversation,"I was wondering for a long time since never met anybody who is or heard that it's even a possibility.

If I'm moving too fast, there's a high chance of panicking and losing grip on a situation. Once I was descending downhill on roller blades, and while everyone had no problem with it, I just felt like I couldn't manage the speed and soon crashed against border stone.

Another example is bicycling at night in the city. It just feels unsafe to accelerate too much on the (almost empty) highways, because it's easy to not notice a car and falling on an asphalt is painful. All it takes to crash is a small stone or an unexpected obstacle.

Couple of months ago I went karting with my friends and just couldn't press the foot pedal all the way because it's SCARY. Overall I somewhat adapted and wasn't even the last. The event made the fear a bit less prominent, but it seems like going face-to-face with it doesn't solve anything.

That's why I'm never learning to drive, go snowboarding or try a big rollercoaster.

Bicycling is great, skiing is, too. Airplanes, society, mirrors, dogs, darkness, etc are fine. But this speed thing is just stupid. It's not even a physical object.

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m moving too fast, there&amp;#39;s a high chance of panicking and losing grip on a situation. Once I was descending downhill on roller blades, and while everyone had no problem with it, I just felt like I couldn&amp;#39;t manage the speed and soon crashed against border stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is bicycling at night in the city. It just feels unsafe to accelerate too much on the (almost empty) highways, because it&amp;#39;s easy to not notice a car and falling on an asphalt is painful. All it takes to crash is a small stone or an unexpected obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple of months ago I went karting with my friends and just couldn&amp;#39;t press the foot pedal all the way because it&amp;#39;s SCARY. Overall I somewhat adapted and wasn&amp;#39;t even the last. The event made the fear a bit less prominent, but it seems like going face-to-face with it doesn&amp;#39;t solve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m never learning to drive, go snowboarding or try a big rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bicycling is great, skiing is, too. Airplanes, society, mirrors, dogs, darkness, etc are fine. But this speed thing is just stupid. It&amp;#39;s not even a physical object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discussed it once with my therapist, but the thing seems to be quite complicated and I didn&amp;#39;t get much information about it. Other than that, not sure there&amp;#39;s any extra fears. So I&amp;#39;m interested if anyone has similar experience, and if yes, why.

So whats the story? A year ago he and others friends work on another company, but we change jobs.

You know whats' funny? in our previous job the guy was exactly the same, he was always late and he was and still is looking excuse for no to work.

This guy cannot speak with client because of the language barrier so he reach a point that the client forgot that he even exits. He just array late to the office, watch youtube, play pokemon go, and call it for the day.

The worst part for me is that on that the company was so desperate for someone that they gave him a BIG salary, bigger than mine and many other people that bust our asses every day.

,CasualConversation,"In highschool (2016-2017) I had this classmate whom I started talking to. I had seen him in junior high aswell, but never got to talk to him due to him being more popular and lowkey intimidating. Being seated next to him in highschool was nervewrecking. I could barely speak to him during the first year (really bad anxiety😥), but the second year it got alot easier as we had projects together with some other closer friends.

He often got bored in class and would whisper about funny things he found while browsing 9gag etc., so he seemed like a really nice and fun guy (still a bit intimidating though). During the last year he went to another school than me but I did see him a few times on the bus, but we didn't talk much (just a simple ""hi"" and a hug).

Recently I began thinking about those years of highschool and how much I miss my classmates, especially the lowkey intimidating guy. I want to message him and catch up, but I'm not sure if that would seem weird. It's been 3 years after all, and we weren't close buddies or anything.

What would you guys do if you were in my shoes, or his? Would it seem creepy or weird? Any advice are welcome!

,CasualConversation,"Well, kind of. 

You see, my father is an advanced life support paramedic in the city of Toronto. One of the most experienced paramedics in city, and he is now a training officer for the region. 

He also loves to read, and when this story took place in 2010 I just binged the first two hunger game books and the third book ""Mocking jay"" was just about to come out. 13 year old me LOVED these books and I kept badgering my dad to read them. He did, and he liked them too! We couldn't wait to get our hands in book three.

Well in 2010, the book ""Mocking Jay"" is published. It sells out like crazy. We couldn't find it for like a week because they ran out at our local book stores. My dad tells me that he will pick up a copy while he's driving around at work. 

So, near the end of his shift I call him telling him that I looked it up and there is a few copy's of the book at this one chapters location in Toronto. Well, Toronto is a big city and its really out of the way from his location but he heads down that way anyway. Gotta get that book! 

As he is nearing the book store, a call pops up on his screen. A lady in a doctor's office is choking. A thick peice of meat is blocking her airway. My dad is the closest paramedic to her, and if there was anyone that had the capability of getting this price of meat out in Toronto that day it would be him. 

He races to the office, just 15 after fire fighters arrive. He sprints into the building and yells at the fire fighters to hold the elevator. They don't. Cussing them out, he sprints up the stairs to the third floor where our victim is now unconscious. 

Now I don't remember exactly the names of the tools he used, but the way he described it was he was basically trying to hook a peice of the meat so he could pull it out. But it's just not coming out. Time is ticking and he is debating about bailing and rushing her to the hospital but he knew she would probably die if he did that so he stays and continues to work at it. Just when he was giving up hope, he manages to pull it up an inch! Then another! Then another! He fully hooks it and pulls it completely out! This freaking piece of meat was so large he couldn't believe it.

He intubates her and takes her to the hospital where she would fully recover. 

This lady probably will never know how lucky she was that a paramedic was in her area, let alone a ALS level three!

I never thought I needed to see anyone because I &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; myself back then and because all my &amp;quot;bad moments&amp;quot; since have gone away within a couple of weeks.&lt;br/&gt;
This past year though, I&amp;#39;ve realized that I&amp;#39;ve adopted very unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with my emotions. But I still put off looking for a therapist and making an appointment for months (probably due to the anxiety.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning I have my first therapy appointment at 34 years old, and even though I&amp;#39;m super nervous, I&amp;#39;m also excited that I&amp;#39;ve finally taken a really important step towards healing.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I like hanging out at the library every now and then, it's a good way to get some cheap entertainment and some quiet.

My local library system is the Hawaii State Public Library System (HSPLS). They have 51 locations across all the islands, and a card is free to sign up for or $5 to replace. Locations are typically open in the morning and afternoon either Monday-Friday or Tuesday-Saturday, with 1-2 days per week opening and closing a few hours later. At each location they have computers which are free to use for 1 hour, but lock you out for 1 hour after that. 

Materials they have include books, cassettes, CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, newspapers, and magazines. You can borrow stuff from one location and return it at a different one. You can also order stuff from different locations to be shipped in and out of your location for reserved pickup.

There is a 25 cents per day late fee, which maxes out at $7.50 total, for each individual item. They also charge you $1 if you don't pick up reserved items or return a VHS tape without rewinding it. If your card has fines exceeding $10, you're locked out borrowing or renting anything until you return the items and/or pay the fines off.

The only downside is their odd pricing and policies. It works like this:

* Books, cassettes, newspapers, and magazines are free and are borrowed for 21 days.
* CDs are free and are borrowed for 21 days, but you can only borrow 10 at a time.
* DVDs and VHS tapes cost $1 for 7 days, and you can only rent up to 10 at a time.
* Hot picks, or books and DVDs that are brand new and in high demand, can only be borrowed for 7 days.

,CasualConversation,"I usually only post when I've got something gloomy to tell, but I'm having a surprisingly good Monday so far, so I thought I'd 'share' something positive for once.

I was in a pretty toxic relationship just a few months ago - we'd been together since we were 16, and while ridiculously incompatible, we were also dangerously codependent and (for some reason) obsessed with each other. 

It was a daily struggle.   
If I wanted to hang out with friends (which I had almost completely stopped doing for a good year of the two-year-relationship), he would get mad at me for 'favouring others over him', at the same time, he spent 98% of his time working on his web shop, myself having slowly but surely faded into the background. I was a silent onlooker, someone with the sole purpose of listening to his career plans and giving advice when wanted, while at the same time becoming a meek shadow of the person I had been at the start of the relationship.

While I knew for a (ridiculously) long time that something needed to change, I was too scared, had gotten far too used to how - while simultaneously painful - comfortable the relationship was. I knew what to look out for, what not to say, how to behave. 

Then, I met this guy. I'll cut the story short, nothing happened while I saw him then, back in the beginning of march, but he started texting me afterwords and, well, I was interested. I felt ashamed, guilty, but how *comfortable* I had felt in his presence kept me on the phone with him - again, I'll cut the story short, but we ended up in a relationship on the 20th or April (Happy 420 lol)

I had ended things with my ex about a week after meeting the guy, coming clean about a few things I hadn't told him (no infidelity) and riding out the heartbreak of the split for about a week, which, considering how scared I had always been of breaking up (thinking I wouldn't be able to 'take it') is remarkable. I had a few quiet moments where he popped back into my head atfer that, naturally, but two months have passed now and he doesn't pass my mind at all anymore. 

I'm a bit taken aback by that as well, for anyone who might think that jumping into a new relationship like that can't be healthy or sane, but I'm pretty sure I must have just been checked out of the old one for a while before the break happened. 

But the way I feel with this one (my ex is the first guy I'd ever been with like that), I can't imagine that anything that happened these months to have been a mistake - I always used to think that what I had with my ex was 'normal' - I thought that was just how relationships work, I shouldn't expect anything else, I shouldn't want anything better. 

But I've got something 'better' now. 

While I'm aware that we're still in the honeymoonphase and all that, I can't put into words just how different this feels, I can't imagine a world where I would be with my ex anymore - I can't put into words how cherished I feel in this new relationship, can't describe how loved and safe I feel, how comfortable to speak, laugh, express myself - it's the complete opposite of the relationship I had been in for the last two years and I'm so excited to fill the next two with positive memories of a happy, balanced relationship.

I honestly just can't fathom how I deserve this, haha.

&lt;p&gt;I was in a pretty toxic relationship just a few months ago - we&amp;#39;d been together since we were 16, and while ridiculously incompatible, we were also dangerously codependent and (for some reason) obsessed with each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a daily struggle.&lt;br/&gt;
If I wanted to hang out with friends (which I had almost completely stopped doing for a good year of the two-year-relationship), he would get mad at me for &amp;#39;favouring others over him&amp;#39;, at the same time, he spent 98% of his time working on his web shop, myself having slowly but surely faded into the background. I was a silent onlooker, someone with the sole purpose of listening to his career plans and giving advice when wanted, while at the same time becoming a meek shadow of the person I had been at the start of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I knew for a (ridiculously) long time that something needed to change, I was too scared, had gotten far too used to how - while simultaneously painful - comfortable the relationship was. I knew what to look out for, what not to say, how to behave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I met this guy. I&amp;#39;ll cut the story short, nothing happened while I saw him then, back in the beginning of march, but he started texting me afterwords and, well, I was interested. I felt ashamed, guilty, but how &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt; I had felt in his presence kept me on the phone with him - again, I&amp;#39;ll cut the story short, but we ended up in a relationship on the 20th or April (Happy 420 lol)&lt;/p&gt;

Generally I just do things (piercings, tattoos etc) without telling them because I’m so scared of what they’ll think. Mostly they just make comments and I’m never confident enough to stand up and tell them I really like it. I feel like my happiness is all that should matter, but I also want my parents to approve. Where’s the balance?&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Sorry for the long post. I don't have anyone to tell these things to so I'm telling my fellow redditors. 

I don't have any friend here in the US. My speaking and writing skill suck. English is my second language and I'm simply a foreigner when talking about American sport, politics, history or culture. Sometimes I have a break down and wonder why I always have to try so hard and work so much and want to give up so bad but I just can't and I won't allow myself to, because I know the moment I let go, every effort my parents and I have made to get me to this point of my life will be wasted.

A little background of me: I'm a trans guy, Asian, not tall or good looking or good at math or at anything. I came from a lower-working class family and had a terrible childhood that full of depression and suicidal thoughts. My parents always fighting to the point that I'm happy that they're divorced now, but they love me and I love them so no worries. I was sexually harassed a few times as a kid but never told anyone because no one would care. I managed to survive 12 years of school and never want to go back. I went to a shitty college to study a shitty major and failed the first year because I was an ass who got drunk 7 days a week.

But hey that was back in the third world country. I came to the US 3 years go. I'm currently 23 and 2 year into college, and have been sober and working so hard (+40 hours a week) for 3 years straight trying to make a living while still managing to keep good grades. I live with my dad to take care of him cause he doesn't know English (my mom didn't come to the US cause they were divorced). I bought my own car, pay for my own expenses and share the bills and rent with my dad. I take 4 classes per semester and work two jobs, one at a restaurant cause it makes decent money and another job at school to put on my resume. I clean the house everyday and exercise to overcome my depression. Sometimes I have anxiety but my dog calm me down. I started reading not too long ago to relax and improve my English. 5 years ago I was an ignorant asshole with nothing in my head and my hands and now I have something and it feels like a great achievement and wonder if my parents feel proud of me for this. It's not much but it's honest work.

I was driving home today and suddenly realized that having so many disadvantages in the past is my best advantage. It taught me to work hard, to understand the value of my hard earn money, and to appreciate and love my family more, and keep my feet going. I don't complain about anything anymore, and when I do, I think about those currently in worse situation than mine and stop. I get to go to college, have a place to live, a car to drive, a job to pay bills, and thankfully my parents are still with me. I have a 10 year plan of working my ass off so my parent and I can retire and live their life comfortably and financially secured. I know it won't be a smooth ride ahead but I hope it won't get to rough. What's past is past and I'm currently very happy with what I have and I think you should too.

,CasualConversation,"I’ve been thinking about this recently because I want to start eating healthy and working out again. I know the usual advice people give is to start out with small steps, and work your way up so you don’t lose hope or motivation too quickly.

But has anybody actually done something completely cold turkey and have it actually work out?

I actually have been able to do this. I (21F) became vegetarian my freshmen year of college, and am still vegetarian 3 and a half years later. I also am not planning on stopping this anytime soon. The only thing that might change is that I plan on becoming a stricter vegetarian as time goes on.

Now the reasonings for my diet switch is another story, but the point is that one day I literally just stopped eating meat and that was that.

I never thought about switching back, I never told myself “oh just one chicken nugget wouldn’t hurt” or “I’ll just eat this burger because it’s a family outing and there’s nothing else to eat”. No, I literally just cold turkey stopped eating meat.

(I do have to mention, I’ve accidentally eaten things that was made with chicken broth, like certain Mac &amp; Cheese, and have eaten jello and marshmallows. But as soon as I found out about those things, I stopped eating them) 

This is the only thing that I have done cold turkey and I think it’s because of my passion or reasoning for it.

Like I said at the beginning of this post, I want to start eating extremely healthy and working out, and I want to get on a strict schedule immediately doing so cold turkey. Over the years I’m always on/off about being in shape, and I feel like it never sticks because of my slow steps and it taking forever to work.

&lt;p&gt;I never thought about switching back, I never told myself “oh just one chicken nugget wouldn’t hurt” or “I’ll just eat this burger because it’s a family outing and there’s nothing else to eat”. No, I literally just cold turkey stopped eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I do have to mention, I’ve accidentally eaten things that was made with chicken broth, like certain Mac &amp;amp; Cheese, and have eaten jello and marshmallows. But as soon as I found out about those things, I stopped eating them) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only thing that I have done cold turkey and I think it’s because of my passion or reasoning for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said at the beginning of this post, I want to start eating extremely healthy and working out, and I want to get on a strict schedule immediately doing so cold turkey. Over the years I’m always on/off about being in shape, and I feel like it never sticks because of my slow steps and it taking forever to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anybody had any luck with doing anything they wanted to do cold turkey? (Doesn’t necessarily have to do with working out/eating right)&lt;/p&gt;

I have mental and emotional issues. I was diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and other disorders.
I have low self esteem, anger issues, and I tend to hold on to grudges easily and for a long time. 

But another thing that impacts my mental health and week being is my thought process and beliefs. 

You see, I currently don’t have ANY friends at all. And I choose to not make any and I purposely isolate myself for long periods of time. 

My problem isn’t anxiety. 

The reason is because I feel like going out of my way make friends feel pathetic because I feel as if I’m looking and ‘needing validation from other people and I’m letting them ‘decide’ my worth. They can either reject me or accept me and be friends with me. 
I rather have people approach me and talk to me.

And another reason why I isolate myself is because of my weird and unobtainable desire to be “special” and unique. I feel like hanging out with people will make me just like them. Average and boring. I wish I could be more than average. I wish I could Stand our from the crowd in a good way. 

However despite all of this I still feel lonely and a desire to have friends and a social circle. I often fantasize about meeting people in anime conventions because I love anime. 
People from anime conventions seem so friendly and fun to be around. I fantasize about hanging with them and talking and having fun and supporting each other and having each other’s backs if something were to happen to us. 

But my personal views keeps me from talking to people.

If you dont say anything or do anything and just let the breakdown pass privately you end up suppressing everything and it takes a toll on you in a different way, often resulting in depression or anxiety issues. However, sometimes sharing dramatically results in getting bullied instead of just being embarrassed about it afterwards so you run that risk too if you overshare. So my question is, which is the right way? I havent been able to figure it out. Express and embarrass or suppress and depress?&lt;/p&gt;

This weekend I worked in a call center that we set up so that loved ones of patients can call for updates.

My last call of the day was different though. The wife of a patient who passed called because in her late husband’s belongings she couldn’t find his valuables, and most importantly his wedding ring. I said that I would try my best to find his belongings.

I knew what she was going through. When I was 14 my dad passed away and I was never given his watch. He was really into watches and had some really nice ones. When I was 12 I decided to buy a watch and gifted it to him. Even-though it was a cheap 20 dollar watch, that was the only watch he wore.

I asked my team if it’s possible that his belongings were still at the hospital. Quickly one of my coworkers told me that they can place valuables in a different place. She quickly went to look while I was on hold with the wife.

Or when there’s some news with only a few people I want to share it with. If others know but not them, it’s unfinished business. It makes me realize who are important in my life, or who I give priority to. And it gives me a chance to re-evaluate if the priority is proper.

Another one is “If it's not real you can't hold it in your hand, you can't feel it with your heart. And I won't believe it. But if it's true you can see it with your eyes, oh even in the dark” from Paramore’s Brick by Boring Brick.

When we look into the sky we see black holes and galaxies revolving around these black holes with stars and planets all interlocked in a complex system. We know the universe is expanding forever and it’s difficult for us to see a clear image of the entire universe.

I’m positive that we have the potential to see more but... 

I’m just wondering (and call me crazy if you’d like) what if we were extremely smaller than the size of an electron (a ratio similar to human:sun) and we sat on top of the electron (cloud of negative energy with mass) and watched it spin around the nucleus (cloud of positive/neutral energy with mass)? 

If we were this small compared to an electron in an atom then, first we would see that the diameter of an atom is suddenly much larger to us. Would the speed at which an electron revolves around a nucleus decrease to our perception?

NPC happiness finally gives me an excuse to have multiple bases, and NPCs finally want something for themselves. Also, I've seen players (especially speedrunners) do downright *sadistic* things, and I guess there is no longer an excuse to create NPC prisons...? Especially since I've heard that the Clentaminator can be expensive to use, and lowered prices on solutions would be great for clearing out corruption/crimson.

The zoologist is just AAAAAAAAAAA. I love her to bits. Her ability to summon a cat/dog NPC is awesome. I've always wanted a ""pet"" that's not just a glorified summon. Also, her accessory that allows you to not accidentally harm critters is great because I'm not a sadist. And dog ears? Assuming that she also sells cat ears, I can finally become a catgirl!

Journey mode... Well, there goes two of my mods. One is now obsolete thanks to item duplication. I will still try to obtain some items legitimately, but some items like glass I do not like obtaining legitimately because I worry about renewability. And I can duplicate corruption items so I can still have them even after clearing it out, or boss drops so I don't have to defeat Moon Lord twice. The other mod is obsolete because infection spread is a lifesaver. I can turn it off in Hardmode before having quarantined it, then turn it back on so my Hallow isn't just a weird stripe. (I'm okay with leaving the Hallow intact.)

And I might cheat with Godmode if I find something too annoying or difficult -I cannot tell you how annoying it is to have harpies interrupt my attempts to get a Sky Crate.

I'm really nervous cause I'm about to beat the End Dragon for the first time in my life. I played Minecraf for a few years when it came out and sporadically over the last 6 or 7 years, I never focused on finishing the game, I've always found really fun the part of constructing a home, a farm and mine, just that. But over the last week I've been watching videos of a speedruner called Dream who managed to get the world record of speedrunnig (twice) and that encouraged me to give it a try, so here I am, after 3 days since I created this last world (it's a bunch of time but for my standards it's quite quickly) I stand before the End Portal, really nervous, with full iron armor, iron tools, a bunch of food, blocks and arrows. Will I make it? idk, I hope so. I just wanted to share it with someone and my friends are sleeping so they'll know tomorrow. 

Love u all! Wish me good luck!

,CasualConversation,"I used to be a boyscout I quit because of mental health reasons completely unrelated to Scouts and in 2019 I quit. But I have some good stories from that time, and I'mma tell them

The Grease Fire- I was on cooking duty for the morning I got up early, had a Dr. Pepper and started the fire. I grabbed the dutch oven and put some sausages and bacon in it, and cooked it. The entire camp woke up to the smell of sausage and bacon. This was in 2017. I strained the grease into a Styrofoam cup. This was a very bad idea. I learned this is about 10 seconds when I looked behind me and saw a fire burning about a 1 foot high. My friend who I'll call John freaked out and threw water on it. Now what do you NOT do with a Grease fire. YOU DONT SPLASH FUCKING WATER ON IT. The fire went an additional foot into the air before I grabbed a fire extinguisher and put it out. I necked John, if you remember necking from back in the day and it's not kissing it's slapping someone hard on the back of the neck. I finished the Mountain Man and fed the entire camp, there was only about 6 people. Lesson: Don't pour water on grease fire and don't pour grease into a styrofoam cup.

Burning rubber down a hill- I went to a summer camp which allowed bikes but not for you to go down big hills, weird right. So I was riding my bike and I was trying to find my camping class to get my camping badge. I found it down a hill I said fuck it, and went down the hill I was going fast I tried to stop it. I heard a sound that made me shit a brick. Click this bike has had issues with brakes for about 3 years but I didn't care I was 13 I was stupid and had crippling depression and thought Filthy Frank was the peak of comedy. I tried a couple of more times I started screaming because I'm going down a hill at mach fucking 6 why wouldnt I fucking scream. I put my feet into the ground and used my poor Walmart shoes as brakes I stopped at the bottom of the hill with my legs all scratched up and bleeding because of rocks. I got yelled at by a camp consular and walked my bike up the hill to my class. Got made fun of rightfully because I was stupid. Lesson: Make sure your breaks fucking work before riding your bike, and remember you ain't invincible.


""Its real blood ye' pricks""- My scout Troop thought it would be fun to do a Haunted Trail for Halloween kinda like a Haunted House except you get ticks and it's cold and you get pathetically scared by teenagers in bandages. I decided to be like a bandaged Killer who would hop out of the woods and scare someone. Grabbed some medical tape and an old shirt. I tore up the old shirt and and wore a long sleeve shirt that had fake blood on it. I tried on the medical tape to see how it would work. I took it off, and took off a part of my lip and started bleeding. I ran to my scout Troop and asked for help they laughed and thought I was kidding and I said I quote, ""THIS IS REAL BLOOD YOU STUPID RETARDED PRICKS"" I was a different person back then, and They thought I was playing thankfully my friend's Mom came outside and patched me up.

I’m not sure if I want to take a gap year or go to college right away, not sure what i’d do in college, it’s all a big jumble of different scenarios that I don’t see myself coming to a conclusion on any time soon. Another problem that’s slightly worrying is even if I were to decide on something to do in college (if I go down that route, of course), I’m a huge culprit of the “the grass is greener on the other side” kind of thought process. If I find myself getting interested in one thing, I’ll lose interest and find something else more interesting all within about 3 days. I’m afraid if I dedicate my time to one thing, it’ll just get old and I’ll regret not picking something else. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Hey guys, this quarantine has caused a very particular situation around the world, everyone is living through it as best as they can. For me it has been really hard. Let me give you a lit context first.

Not so long ago I was knee deep in a depression that had been going since the 8th grade, finally last year I had the opportunity to have a fresh start and finally started getting better. As every illness leaves a mark, it left me with severe loneliness and problems with building relationships. I always felt no one really cared for me, I always had to be the one reaching out to people, I felt I was a second friend to most of my close friends. When I got the chance to start fresh I managed to make new friendships and renew old ones and all those feelings of loneliness went away.

Coming back to the quarantine, many of those friends stopped responding, I always had carry the conversation, everything from before came rushing back and it brought along the depression. Now I feel like I'm not even worth replying too during a quarantine. One of the closest friends that always helped me during breakdowns broke my heart (not romantically) by inviting me and behind my back another friend to a get away for New years. The day before New Years he tells me that he actually had only one spot and he had invited me and the other friend expecting the other friend would cancel, that didn't happen, so I got the boot. You may see why I feel like a second hand friend.

I just want to tell anyone who is going through a rough spot right now that it gets better, after winter always comes spring. Loneliness is a bitch, it makes you doubt everything and everyone, don't let it win. And remember there are people out there that deeply care for you.

,CasualConversation,"Me, my mother and my sister were casually playing Clue. 
Now I know a lot of people know how to play, but let me explain a little for the ones who live in a cave : Clue is a board game where you have to find the murderer of a millionaire in his mansion. You need to find the culprit between 6 characters, and with what weapon and in what room he’s been killed.

I started the game with an amazing deck, with 4 rooms, 1 character and 1 weapon. FYI, there’s 9 rooms in the game, so it’s the most difficult piece of evidence to find. I already had an advantage against my mother, who might I say, is an incredible strategy player. We continued playing and, with incredible luck, put myself (on tour 3 or 4) in a room that I already had with one weapon and one character that NO ONE had in their hand. So I already cleared two of my objectives by knowing who and with what weapon they killed the millionaire with. Now I only needed to find the room in which he was killed in. The game continued shortly but was really tense. When I was finally ready to accuse, my mother accused right before me! 

That’s where I activate my trap card. 

Throughout the game, the places where everyone went were usually places that I already had in my deck, so when they were questioning who, where and with what, I was only showing the rooms and with SO MUCH chance, I managed to never show my weapon card. 

So I won because my mother accused with the wrong weapon. 
Best game of my life, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have that much chance in my life ever again.

One couple even took us to a walking trail then picked us up at the end of the day and brought us home for a shower and roast chicken...some of the kindest people I&amp;#39;ve met and really refreshing change from the incredibly vitriolic and polarized internet screaming I see every day.  &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Okay, so I am SUPER imaginative. I don’t mean I’m creative, I just mean that I get distracted by the brain farts that consistently come out of me. However, when I am listening to music, those figurative clouds become ONE ENTIRE SCENE. Like, I’ll be listening to Taylor Swift, and I come up with an entire scene in Hazbin Hotel. HUH?! You might not know what I mean; let me explain. When I listen to music, I usually come up with a scenario in my head. Usually, one song equals one scenario, but they can sometimes switch between scenarios depending on how I’m feeling. I literally have Spotify playlists that are titled a certain show. It’s weird but super entertaining. Here are a few for your amusement:


• Mean (Taylor Swift): Charlie is at a country bar, gets fed up with Alastor being a psychopath, and, to his either amusement or sorrow, she does karaoke to this song whilst being backed up by other demons.


• Fireflies (Owl City): Scout gets horrible insomnia from his ADHD and has hallucinations while wandering outside the base. It’s only after Medic gets him inside and gives him medication does he fall asleep. Medic leaves the bedroom, but not before setting a jar of fireflies on his bedside table.


• Have You Seen My Sister Evelyn? (Evelyn Evelyn): The Devil from Cuphead grants two twins the ability to get along with each other and sync up, per the mother’s instructions (she’s the one who asks for a favor). However, they only get along when other people are around, including when they are singing this song for a gig. They find ways to gently annoy each other while singing this duet, and then they are heard beating the living snot out of each other in their dressing room once they think their alone. However, King Dice hears them, then collects their souls when they eventually kill each other.


• Talking To The Moon (Bruno Mars): Pitch Black from The Guardians is talking to the moon, which is where his deceased daughter’s soul is. He sings the song while trying to get enough black sand to reach the moon, but the light prohibits him. However, this version would be on a music box, which would fade into the original. Jack and Sandy may be witnesses.

He was the kindest dog and I loved him growing up, too bad I don't have many memories of him as I was a baby.

Unfortunately he died of old age and my auntie took him out on a mountain and buried him.

So today, about 20 years later, when we were watching this other dog that looked similar to Gildor at the park, I told her ""hey that dog looks like him"". 

And she said, ""nah, Gildor was more respectful and adorable"". Which I thought, how can a dog be respectful?

But then I realised the bonds we form with our pets and the stuff we feel and experience, it's probably really personal to us and really hard to explain to others.

I also asked her ""ever thought of getting another one?""

And she said ""I think he was the one for me, I don't think I could ever replace him or bond with another dog. ""

We were just done with our OHT# 1 (One Hour Tests) that our department takes every 5 weeks. I made friends with a new group of people on the day of my last test which also had a girl I had began to take interest in. 

I was really excited to join that group, as I wanted to get closer to her and what not. We even hung out on that second last weekend before the holidays came to support a friend who was taking part in a poetry competition, and then went for bowling afterwards.

Then this mess came....at first I didn't think much about it and so I didn't pack much before going home. Thought this would be a 3 week hustle MAX. 

Coming back home after a week online classes started which were a huge drag. I couldn't get a single word what my instructor tried to convey to us. I always either simultaneously listened to music or watched a TV series, keeping tabs on the class so as to not miss my attendance.

Then the Lockdown stretched on and it was aired that all educational institutions would be closed till July 15th.

 Bummer.

I had alot planned for the summer of 2020. I had 2 internships planned, one of which was even paid. I was to practice the guitar and get better at it which I had left in my dorm room since I packed light. I was to have gotten closer to this girl I liked by now, had this lockdown never came.

But being stuck at home and without what I could have had I started to think about doing different things. I thought to expand on my Creative writing which I hadn't poked at for several years. 3rd week into lockdown I started to write songs on my notepad app. I also started to write a sci-fi, adventure novel as well in a rough journal. As of yet the first part of 6 is complete and only needs to be written in neat.

I have also thought about learning how to produce electronic music through software like FL Studio 20 and then hopefully have a fully published song by the end of this quarantine.

,CasualConversation,"So two days ago when I was chilling on my bed, a bug flew in from the window. I didn’t care that much, just assumed it may be a mosquito or something. 

But yesterday, man, I found out that’s a HUGE ASS bug. I don’t know what it is, it has a long body and long, thin legs. When it’s resting on the wall it spreads out and is just disgusting. 

I kinda try to ignore it, since it’s not hurting me when it’s resting on the wall. But every once in a while it comes flying into my FACE and no. I cannot live with that. 

18:00 I opened the door and sprayed some hand sanitizer on it to signal it to leave. Wouldn’t budge. 

21:00 Went out and got back. The bug is nowhere to be seen. Okay cool. Went to make dinner. 

22:45 Right after I finish my dinner, I found that it has been right behind me on the wall this whole time. Oh god those long legs give me shivers. 

00:00 Sat on a chair which I don’t normally sit on just to be as far from it as possible. I was regretting why I didn’t get a bug spray at the supermarket earlier and pondering the possibility of going to sleep tonight. 

01:30 Finally decided I had to do something. Put on my jacket, mask, gloves, and tried to hit it with my umbrella. No use. I almost finished the whole bottle of hand sanitizer and it did nothing but make my bed all wet. At this point I was in tears. I legit BROKE DOWN because I couldn’t rest, I was pacing around the room, I was trying to overcome my fear of it but couldn’t, and just saw no end to this whole situation. 

03:00 Texted boyfriend about it. He just woke up (different time zone) and we normally have a video chat, but I wasn’t in the mood so we texted. 

04:30 I decided to call the bf, as listening to his voice may calm me down a bit. This frigging bug comes flying around me AGAIN! 

05:00 Got my jacket, gloves and mask on again and got a broom to try to kill it. Boyfriend was on the phone the whole time to talk me through it and be there with me. 

05:30 It finally flew to a lower place on the wall, and it took me about 10 minutes to pluck up the courage and smash it with a pizza-box shaped box. 

Phew, so that was it. Since around 23:00 last night until now, after six hours, I can finally go to sleep. At times like this I really envy those who are not afraid of bugs or even those who like them. Also, it’s my first time living alone, so had to deal with this all by myself.

&lt;p&gt;I kinda try to ignore it, since it’s not hurting me when it’s resting on the wall. But every once in a while it comes flying into my FACE and no. I cannot live with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18:00 I opened the door and sprayed some hand sanitizer on it to signal it to leave. Wouldn’t budge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21:00 Went out and got back. The bug is nowhere to be seen. Okay cool. Went to make dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22:45 Right after I finish my dinner, I found that it has been right behind me on the wall this whole time. Oh god those long legs give me shivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:00 Sat on a chair which I don’t normally sit on just to be as far from it as possible. I was regretting why I didn’t get a bug spray at the supermarket earlier and pondering the possibility of going to sleep tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;01:30 Finally decided I had to do something. Put on my jacket, mask, gloves, and tried to hit it with my umbrella. No use. I almost finished the whole bottle of hand sanitizer and it did nothing but make my bed all wet. At this point I was in tears. I legit BROKE DOWN because I couldn’t rest, I was pacing around the room, I was trying to overcome my fear of it but couldn’t, and just saw no end to this whole situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;03:00 Texted boyfriend about it. He just woke up (different time zone) and we normally have a video chat, but I wasn’t in the mood so we texted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;04:30 I decided to call the bf, as listening to his voice may calm me down a bit. This frigging bug comes flying around me AGAIN! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;05:00 Got my jacket, gloves and mask on again and got a broom to try to kill it. Boyfriend was on the phone the whole time to talk me through it and be there with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;05:30 It finally flew to a lower place on the wall, and it took me about 10 minutes to pluck up the courage and smash it with a pizza-box shaped box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew, so that was it. Since around 23:00 last night until now, after six hours, I can finally go to sleep. At times like this I really envy those who are not afraid of bugs or even those who like them. Also, it’s my first time living alone, so had to deal with this all by myself. Anyway, I really wanna know how y’all deal with bugs, especially those that stay on the high ceilings! I could really use some skills here.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I've just been feeling shitty and depressed for weeks. I just recently realized it's because of some of the subreddits I follow is making me feel this way. I followed things like r/trashy and r/entitledpeople since I thought it's entertaining and funny how some people are idiots. But then it comes to a point where I see so much of it and it reminds me that the world is a shitty place. Also that so much idiocy doesn't seem funny anymore, it gets depressing. I already know that these kinds of people exist. I don't need to be reminded about it everyday.

So I just went through my list and unfollowed a bunch of subreddits that are like that. There's still news related subreddits I follow like r/hongkong that I follow so I can stay informed. That also gets depressing, but it's different. I look through that subreddit and feel hopeful that things would get better. In the subreddits like trashy and entitled I just think, ""these people are hopeless"" and lose faith in humanity. I care about the wellbeing of Hong Kongers, not Covid-19 protesters that want everything to open up again. 

Anyway, I feel like I'm already feeling better. Most of the subreddits I follow are animal related. Mostly cats. I would feel better waking up the next morning and the first thing I see is a cat sitting on a pizza box.

I just recently realized it&amp;#39;s because of some of the subreddits I follow is making me feel this way. I followed things like &lt;a href=""/r/trashy""&gt;r/trashy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/r/entitledpeople""&gt;r/entitledpeople&lt;/a&gt; since I thought it&amp;#39;s entertaining and funny how some people are idiots. But then it comes to a point where I see so much of it and it reminds me that the world is a shitty place. Also that so much idiocy doesn&amp;#39;t seem funny anymore, it gets depressing. I already know that these kinds of people exist. I don&amp;#39;t need to be reminded about it everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just went through my list and unfollowed a bunch of subreddits that are like that. There&amp;#39;s still news related subreddits I follow like &lt;a href=""/r/hongkong""&gt;r/hongkong&lt;/a&gt; that I follow so I can stay informed. That also gets depressing, but it&amp;#39;s different. I look through that subreddit and feel hopeful that things would get better. In the subreddits like trashy and entitled I just think, &amp;quot;these people are hopeless&amp;quot; and lose faith in humanity. I care about the wellbeing of Hong Kongers, not Covid-19 protesters that want everything to open up again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I feel like I&amp;#39;m already feeling better. Most of the subreddits I follow are animal related. Mostly cats. I would feel better waking up the next morning and the first thing I see is a cat sitting on a pizza box.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I have been a Reddit lurker years. A few days back, I tried creating a subreddit for a topic I enjoy. I found out that you need a positive karma for that.

So yesterday, I did something I couldn’t bring myself to do for years: comment on people’s posts. I always find it scary before since you wouldn’t know what people will reply to you. But I wanted to get over that.

To my surprise, it was so fun! I love how you can have discussions with other people about the topic, or sometimes encourage and help other people to pursue their interests more (especially for those posts that have little upvotes or comments).

A couple of learnings:
- I find it hard to participate in large subs due to the number of posts in new. I enjoy smaller and niche subs more.
- Personally created content is so much better than a repost of someone else’s.
- It’s not about upvotes. Be authentic as you are while complying to the rules.
- I enjoyed it better when I treated Reddit as a community rather than the typical social media where you just consume content.
- I love people! It’s so heartwarming for me to know more about the lives and thoughts of others and learn from them.

A few days back, I tried creating a subreddit for a topic I enjoy. I found out that you need a positive karma for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday, I did something I couldn’t bring myself to do for years: comment on people’s posts. I always find it scary before since you wouldn’t know what people will reply to you. But I wanted to get over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, it was so fun! I love how you can have discussions with other people about the topic, or sometimes encourage and help other people to pursue their interests more (especially for those posts that have little upvotes or comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of learnings:
- I find it hard to participate in large subs due to the number of posts in new. I enjoy smaller and niche subs more.
- Personally created content is so much better than a repost of someone else’s.
- It’s not about upvotes. Be authentic as you are while complying to the rules.
- I enjoyed it better when I treated Reddit as a community rather than the typical social media where you just consume content.
- I love people! It’s so heartwarming for me to know more about the lives and thoughts of others and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all those said, how do you enjoy Reddit? Do you have any tips how I can enjoy it more? Is it better to join a few subs I’m really interested and invested in, rather than follow a ton?&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I've been avoiding going on my balcony for quite some time now, because for some reason wasps really like hanging around there, and I've been quite scared of wasps since I was stung by 4 at the same time when I was little. It really stuck with me and since then I freak out whenever I hear buzzing close to me or when I see a flying insect heading towards me that I can't really identify. I know it's pretty irrationnal but I really can't help it

So instead of going on my balcony, I'm just content with staring outside the window and enjoying the view lol. And plus I can observe the wasps from a safe place, which, even though I'm afraid of them, they're pretty interesting to observe I think. And that led me to see something a bit weird :

I noticed that the wasps that fly around my appartment fly in sort of a weird way in comparison to your typical flying insects : their legs kinda dangle under them, as if they didn't really know what to do with them.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to google ""wasps with legs dangling when flying"" and I found out that these wasps were paper wasps, which, as I found out after researching a bit more, are actually reputed for being pretty chill and only attacking when really threatened, unlike yellow jackets who apparently are more aggressive, and kinda like bees. You can differentiate from yellow jackets because yellow jackets don't fly with their legs hanging.

And that made me feel a bit safer, because now I can look at how the wasp flies and determine if I should go back inside or just calm down and let it do its thing. I mean, I think I'll probably still panick, but it may help me feel less threatened and maybe I can even try to enjoy spending time on my balcony every once in a while...

 I don't know why my sister and I say ""Paper Rock Scissors"" but no one has ever tried correcting us as of recently. Its like no one noticed before or something. I've always known that other people would say ""Rock Paper Scissors"" and I thought it was just preference until people started telling me that I'm saying it wrong lol

Do you guys know of any reasons why it would be one way or the other? I'm just genuinely curious.

I’ve always been a skinny dude (19m) and I can eat anything without putting much weight on if any. So hopefully with a healthy diet and exercise, I can get myself in good shape.

Today was 95 and it&amp;#39;s slowly starting to get higher I&amp;#39;m the following weeks. I cannot function in heat. I feel dizzy, I lose motivation to do anything, I get shaky, and my body and mental state does not I improve until I take my shower at night. On any other normal day, I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with the heat much because I&amp;#39;m at work where it&amp;#39;s air conditioned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working from home for 2 months now and my mental state from being inside all day has already taken a toll on me. Now this heat is making it worse. I have to be working from home in this heat and I don&amp;#39;t have access to the A/C controls. I rent out a room and I&amp;#39;m at the mercy of my landlords. They are generally ok and will turn it on as needed. But still, I just wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about which temperature I&amp;#39;ll be most comfortable working in. I&amp;#39;m sure many of you who pay for your own electric bill will also now have to consider a higher bill since you&amp;#39;ll be using you&amp;#39;re A/C more.

,CasualConversation,"So most of this actually happened last year but I still fell like sharing this story. Also sorry long post!

Last year my fiance and I decided to surprise our friends we hadn't seen in the past year by showing up at their graduation. It was a 10+ hours drive but we were determined. So after a long day of taking finals for me and of working for my fiance we packed the car and we hit the road.  The first part of the trip went smoothly until 2:30AM. 

We are very very low on gas and pull up at a gas station in the middle of nowhere to fill up. Fiance's credit card gets denied over and over again, and I realize that  I must have forgotten mine back home. To make matters worse we did not have any cash on us. We were now stranded in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, with no money and no gas. By calling the bank emergency phone line we learned that his card had been deactivated because it had been hacked and used in another country. The only way to get another one was to wait for a bank nearby to open. We knew that at this point we would have no way to make it in time to our friend's graduation. We sat inside the gas station to wait it out.

After 30 or so minutes one of the gas station employee came to see us and asked us what was the problem. We explained the all thing, where we were from and where we were going and why. He nodded, left us for a minute and came back with his wallet. ""How much do you need to get there?"". We were dumbfounded and at first did not want to accept it. In the end he gave us $100 and told us to use it for gas to go see our friend's graduation. We offered to leave some of our valuables with him in exchange and that he could hold on to it until we came to pay him back. He refused. He didn't know us and still was more than willing to help us out.

We made it to our friends's graduation and had a great day with them (we haven't seen them in person since then because they moved all over the US and world). We got a new credit card. Before we left to go back to our place, we stopped at a Starbuck and the person before us had paid for our drink, it is a detail but still made our day. 

On our way back we, of course, stopped at that same gas station, and paid him back + some extras to thank him for what he did. This stranger, well the two of them because I can't forget about Starbuck stranger either, helped us or paid for something for us even though they did not know us and had nothing to gain in return. They've changed my view on things and had a way bigger impact on our lives that they can imagine. Faith in humanity restored. 

Well since then, we've been able to save a bit more money so we could start paying it forward too. Last weekend we helped a few people in need to buy some food and other first necessities. And yesterday we went to get ice cream at a drive-thru and paid for the couple behind us. Well they managed to follow us (that what we get for having a very recognizable car) and stopped to say thank you. It is such a small thing, but seeing their smiles on their faces was just amazing.

,CasualConversation,"This has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I have not been sure how to put it into words.

With the large number of people protesting the stay at home orders, it just shows what kind of people we live with. I don't want to single anyone out, but it, to me, looks like the type of people who tell you that you should follow the rules but when it affects them it becomes a problem. I get it, but at the same time, I do not. People are bringing guns to these events and that scares me because you never know what kind of psycho are at these events. 

Now you are getting people who don't understand things are closed for a reason. Like today, some lady shot 3 people at a McDonald's. Why? Because the sitting area was closed. How about when that security guard got shot because someone didn't want to wear a mask? That is scary because it feels like it could be anyone who would shoot someone for not wanting to wear a mask.
