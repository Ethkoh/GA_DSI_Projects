,Parenting,"My son's dad has a gf that he has been with for about 4.5 years now- so since my son was 3.

Since the beginning, she's always been rude and controlling to my son.

When my son was younger, he used to be very sad about it and cry about it when he came home. Now that he is older, he just  has a lot of anger covering that sadness.

My son's dad knows this is true but he's super passive/passive aggressive and also can't be alone, so he has stayed with her. Now she is pregnant so that complicates things even more.  


Some of the situations are really just weird things, like petty little things and harassing him about wearing specific clothes she buys him... forcing him to eat things he doesn't want to, not letting him eat or drink except certain times (his dad and I are fine with pretty free range behaviors as long as it's healthy choices), she argues with him consistently and uses big words he says he doesn't understand, she speaks to him sarcastically, and she accuses him of things and calls him a liar. I feel like she is a bully. 

This situation is getting worse and my son is starting to develop behavioral issues and stress about going there. He's developed a weird fear about me dying because he doesn't want to be left with them. He also doesn't want to be left alone with her if my son's dad goes to work or has to run errands. We are 50/50 custody. I don't want my son to be developing weird complexes because of this. The stress of this is affecting me, too. If I try to get more time, I will need child support. I also know that my son's dad won't give up more time with him. Going through the legal system and this fight again sounds like hell on earth. 

I haven't intervened or spoken to her-- I've only spoken to my son's dad. But now, I'm going to speak to her.

,Parenting,"Help! We have three children, 2(m), 4(m), 7(f) and for the most part they are all great kids. However, our 4 year old is a screamer. All day long, it's a constant stream of ear drum shattering screeches. He screams when he's happy, when he's scared, when he's excited, when he's angry. It's become a major problem. 

Both my wife and I have developed minor PTSD because of it. When I arrive home I can already hear ear piercing wails from the driveway, inside I find my wife eating dinner quietly with a despondent glazed stare as the 4 year old screams his brains out. After hours of this we both tend to snap at him, ourselves screaming ""Quiet!!!"" or tossing him in his room for a few moments of silence. 

It's also a problem for our neighbors, an older couple on one side and a woman with cancer on the other side who has a very difficult time sleeping. The other day he was up at 7am, playing outside on the swing and screaming loud enough that I could hear him inside, on the other side of the house. The swing set it close enough to the neighbor's window that I'm sure he's woken them up more than once. He also screams when we go for walks in the neighborhood, when we're at the library, outside of his sister's school. Besides being embarrassing, I'm genuinely concerned that someone is going to call the police on us. Or worse, that something will happen to our active two years old who tends to run off while I'm dealing with the screaming.

This has been going on for years and we have tried everything: Hugs, weighted blanket, timeouts, eating ice chips, sticker chart, going for walks, empathetic listening, taking away tablet time, begging, pleading, sacrificial blood letting ceremonies (kidding). It's frustrating because his happy screams are the same as his angry screams, and anything can trigger it so there's no real way to remove the trigger. Some of today's triggers included: not having a piece of blue chalk, the 2 year old touched his doll's dress, he washed his hands with soap, got a dollop of whipped cream with his strawberries, his bicycle tipped over.

My daughter has had some issues with schooling/learning since kindergarten(a five minute assignment can take her up to an hour because she gets distracted, starts thinking of other stuff, forgets to read all the instructions, etc) but has been at or above grade level on the work she does. We thought this was just a kid thing that she would grow out of but it has worsened with time and started to affect her schooling (becoming sad at missing out on class activities because she had to finish work, etc) We got her tested for ADD- doctor said that she meets the diagnosis for an ADD-inattentive diagnosis BUT he recommended that I just talk to the next teacher at the beginning of the year and see if they could work with my daughter rather than have an official diagnosis of ADD and if the teacher wouldn’t work with her then they could put the diagnosis in as official and create a 504 plan.

,Parenting,"So I want to start this by saying I have no problems with any sexualities and how people or my chidlren identify themselves.

About a month ago.. our 11 year old started identifying as a bi-sexual not to us as such.. but to her friends and was really making a bold statement about it telling everyone over their chat groups. We didn't really bother much as we always spoke infront of her that we don't think she needs to come to us and make any statements about who she wants to be.. one day she will bring home a girl or a boy and we will welcome them and sit down with them and have a chat irrelavant of gender. 

The issue escalated though .. when she decided she likes one of her closest friends. And asked her to be her girlfriend. They have been in this phase of boyfriend s and being in couples all year and I have told her numerous times even with boys she liked.. that I do believe they are too young to be stressing out over these things but let it be and made no big fuss- as their idea of being a couple is a childish one anyway and aren't doing anything couples do, and didn't want to invalidate whatever it was she was feeling. Now back to the point this girl she likes told her no and that she is straight. This didn't go down well and my daughter started to some extent manipulating the situation. First telling the girl to consider and pushing her.. and then asked her if they can try for a week (mind you we were in lockdown ) and see how she feels. When this didn't work she asked another friend to talk to this girl and tell her how unfair she was being how she made my daughter sad. At this point we intervened sat my daughter down and spoke to her.. we explained that while we have absolutely no problem with her identifying as whoever she wants, she cannot force people or manipulate them into being in a relationship with her irrelavant of gender. This she has understood and since then everything calmed down. 

Now 3 weeks later and with the slight easment of lockdown this girl's mother has invited my daughter to their house for a small pool party on the roof. Only my daughter is invited and the reason for this is that she is the only friend this girl is allowed to have over ( super diciplened parents). Now my issue comes here.. I am very sure this girl's mother doesn't know about the situation above, and don't want this to spill over while I won't be there and not sure how another parent would react. My second issue is if I believe my daughter's feelings are true and don't want to dismiss them, the best solution is to not see this girl until she has put her feelings aside. On the other hand though telling her I don't want her to go might send the signal to my daughter that I'm only doing this because she said she is bi.

,Parenting,"My 9yo boy has been asking to be homeschooled for a couple of years now. He’s always performed above grade level and been hella bored in school. And the “gifted” program really didn’t enrich his curriculum enough to make a difference. He basically just got extra work. I had looked into homeschooling several times but never really felt like I could pull it off. A few weeks after the lockdown happened, I started looking at resources and stuff and decided this was a good time to try out some things. I know real homeschooling involves trips to different places and more “out of the box” type learning so we obviously haven’t been going anywhere, but I felt like he was doing really well with online resources and reading and stuff. Some days have gone better than others, but overall I felt like we were doing okay. He was excited to finally get to do what he thought he wanted. 

Well yesterday I wasn’t feeling well, I spent most of the day in bed and he spent almost all day on video games or whatever. I asked him to please work on something, anything, he could choose the topic, but he didn’t. I felt too ill to argue so I just gave up. I don’t know if this had anything to do with what happened today so I’m just throwing this part in there. 

His default activity in the morning is to get on his switch, and during lockdown I’ve just let it slide because... well whatever. I don’t know. We usually start on educational stuff around lunch time. But sometimes it’s a bit of a drag getting him to transition. 

So with being sick yesterday and getting tired of the switch being his default activity, last night after he went to bed I put his switch up so he wouldn’t just jump straight on it in the morning. We had errands to run, take the dog to the vet, etc, and when we got home I said he has to do some educational stuff before he gets his switch time today. We got home and I was working on some bills and I heard games in his room. I went in and he switched to an educational tab really quick. I calmly asked what that was about and he immediately started crying (?) and said “I told you there’s something wrong with me.” ((He said that yesterday when I got onto him for getting mad at the dog for bothering him in the car)) Earlier this morning he had gotten mad about something else and had said that again too. I had a brief talk with him about hormones and he would probably start having some really strong feelings that felt like come out of nowhere, and that’s normal to feel some intense emotions as you grow up, etc. trying to be supportive. 

Anyway he went in the living room after that and was pouting or whatever because he got caught, and I looked at his browser history to see how much schoolwork, if any, he had done. The first tab he looked at was one of the educational sites-mental health-video on depression. 

I went and hugged him asked him about it and he just laid there, didn’t say anything. I told him he could talk to me. He just held onto me for a minute and was being really sweet and cuddly and after a little while just changed the subject.

Wtf. I don’t know what to do with this information. We get along pretty well, or I thought we did. He’s my only child, I’m terrified of screwing him up. I don’t know if this was just an over dramatic reaction to feeling like he is “grounded” from video games (he is not) or if this is some lurking issue, lockdown burnout, or what but it just shook me up especially since he won’t talk to me.

I had a brief talk with him about hormones and he would probably start having some really strong feelings that felt like come out of nowhere, and that’s normal to feel some intense emotions as you grow up, etc. trying to be supportive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway he went in the living room after that and was pouting or whatever because he got caught, and I looked at his browser history to see how much schoolwork, if any, he had done. The first tab he looked at was one of the educational sites-mental health-video on depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went and hugged him asked him about it and he just laid there, didn’t say anything. I told him he could talk to me. He just held onto me for a minute and was being really sweet and cuddly and after a little while just changed the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wtf. I don’t know what to do with this information. We get along pretty well, or I thought we did. He’s my only child, I’m terrified of screwing him up. I don’t know if this was just an over dramatic reaction to feeling like he is “grounded” from video games (he is not) or if this is some lurking issue, lockdown burnout, or what but it just shook me up especially since he won’t talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be gentle with me, I love my little dude so much.&lt;/p&gt;

For months now, my partner and I have been trying to train our 2 year old to sleep in her own bed without too much issue. Not only does she struggle to fall asleep, as she moves often and will lift her head like she's checking to see if we're there; she also wakes up randomly throughout the night crying and calling for mom. The latter is the problem we need help solving.

We have a fairly regularly routine before bed. Most lights off around 9, and we'll watch a movie, read a book, or play with blocks. If we have tea, she gets her spoon and has some of mom's caffeine-free chamomile tea. Then around 9:30-9:45, we lay her down with some piano music in the background. 

We know we could probably do without the TV so close to bedtime, but there seems to be no real difference between TV nights and non-TV nights.

We tend to stay with her until she falls asleep and then return to our room to sleep, though the frustration of waking up repetitively through the night to put her back to sleep ends up resulting in mom sleeping in her bed/on the floor next to her. I've tried to answer her crying, but she only wants mom. 

We've even tried bringing her bed into our room for a while, and she'll still start crying when she wakes up even though we're in sight.

The only thing we haven't done yet is just letting her cry it out, because (a) we have downstairs neighbors with young children who we don't want to disturb, (b) we're softies, and (c) she'll just walk herself to our room anyway.

,Parenting,"I wish we didn't have to think about this so seriously, but especially with Covid-19 and my husband working in the front-lines of healthcare, we've had to face an issue that's been plaguing us since our first kid was born. Who do we leave the kids (6M, 3M) to if something should happen to us? Googling about the issue just makes us feel worse. How do we decide between a bunch of bad options? 

Here are our slim pickings options (and note these are our TOP options):

Husband's Side: We live far from family so nobody has seen our kids more than 10 times.

Sibling 1: Male, divorced. Wants kids in theory but more because it's an experience he hasn't had yet and wants to pass on his genes (his words). Good career with good hours, but is very self-involved due to high levels of health anxiety. Spends most of his time complaining to us about his life and mostly ignores the kids, but sends gifts on birthdays.

Sibling 2: Female, married. Has one child (1F). Looks good on paper with a good job now, but work history is unstable and has been let go more than once. She has outsourced most of the parenting to her elderly parents who complain that they have the baby basically 12 hours a day. Husband plays video games or watches TV all day. She lives near family, but has social anxiety and basically avoids all family events and is a shut-in outside of work. Has been nice to our kids during the few, brief meetings we've had.

Parents: Elderly and already strained taking care of baby. Also has back problems so not going to be great with rambunctious boys.

Cousin 1: Female, married with own kid (5F) who is special needs. She seems to be doing well and they seem like good, stable parents, but they are expecting another child and not sure if they want to take on two more. She and my husband were not very close as kids, but have gotten closer since they were the first in the family to have kids.

Cousin 2: Female, married with own kid (2M). Only family member that has always shown a love for kids in general. However, she and her husband have developed radical political views and become alienated from parts of the family. I'm not talking your typical Trump Supporter or SJW. Take it two notches higher. We are on the same side of the political spectrum and are uncomfortable with their views.

Cousin 3: Female, married with one kid (3F) and unlikely to have more kids. Has been the nicest of all the family to our kids and shown the most interest (given the limited amount of time we've spent with them). However, she is a distant cousin that we don't know well and it feels awkward to give our kids to relatives of relatives that we don't know very well.

My side (even slimmer): I have no siblings and no family other than my parents that has actually met my kids since most of my next of kin lives in another country and I haven't been back since childhood. None of these are real options.

Parents: Also elderly. I had a really unhappy childhood growing up. My parents have since mellowed and adore my kids and will move wherever they need to to take care of them. But they don't speak English well and would have trouble communicating with my kids.

Cousin 1: Female, married with one kid (2F). Lives in the US with her American husband. I've only seen her twice since I moved away when I was a young kid. She seems nice and they are older so well-established in their careers. I can't tell what kind of parent she is, other than they take their kid on vacations to Hawaii and Disney and whatnot.

Friend 1: Female, married with two kids (6M and 9F). She's probably the closest to us in values and parenting style. However, we've drifted apart in the last 5 years just because we have busy lives and don't live super close. She also doesn't live near any of our family.

So there you have it folks! Hopefully none of these people are on reddit to read my glowing reviews of them. We are a loss as to what to do and just go around in circles from one option to the next. Thanks for bearing with me...it was helpful just to type things out. Any thoughts or advice on how we should approach this are welcome!

However, we&amp;#39;ve drifted apart in the last 5 years just because we have busy lives and don&amp;#39;t live super close. She also doesn&amp;#39;t live near any of our family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it folks! Hopefully none of these people are on reddit to read my glowing reviews of them. We are a loss as to what to do and just go around in circles from one option to the next. Thanks for bearing with me...it was helpful just to type things out. Any thoughts or advice on how we should approach this are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

My daughter has anxieties about sleeping by herself and it's been a uphill battle. Me and her mother are divorced. So at my house for the last few years I've been teaching her how to sleep alone. At her mum's place that doesn't happen. 

Recently though it's got better. Although shes been coming out with excuses like her arm hurts. Couldn't find anything wrong. I had to take her to the doctor and they couldn't find anything either. 

Then few days later when she goes back to her mum's (they've recently started to get her to sleep alone) she's complaining of her leg hurting. So her mum takes her to the hospital in the middle of the night. Takes her in a wheel chair...

I thought I'd maybe come to Reddit for help, along with the help of my mothers. 😅

My fiance and I had a beautiful baby girl on the 7th of May. Brought her home yesterday. It's been challenging to say the least and we're waaay out of our comfort zones. 

If anyone has any advice to offer, I'd appreciate it so much.

1. I've got her on both formula and breastmilk. I decided to try it that way because yesterday drained me entirely when I was only breastfeeding and I was awake until 6am in tears.

2. We started out giving her 30ml when she'd get a bottle of breastmilk. The formula instructions told us to give 60ml of it so we changed to that.

3. Pretty sure I overfed her yesterday because she was up most of the night, screaming and crying. Kind of like tonight.

4. She only drank 20ml at one point this afternoon which was odd and then later I gave her the normal 60ml.

5. We've given her gripe water and another brand ofn colic drops on her dummy.

6. She sleeps like a princess when she's with one of us, but as soon as we put her in her cot she's awake. I don't want her to sleep in the bed with us because of the risks.

7. She's currently awake at 02.07am, crying and screaming every few minutes, and we're trying to get gas out. I last gave her a bottle at 11pm, and then put her on the breast about 15 minutes ago and she drank a little bit.

Kid A had put the shower head up at an angle so that if turned on, water would shoot straight out into the bathroom.

Since the quarantine, I have been home more and I see the impact of parents not parenting and not setting clear boundaries and this was evident and getting bad with my daughter.  My response was to attempt to redirect and discipline her.  Whether this was to clean up or enforce not eating in the living room or disciple her for sometimes yelling at my mom.  What I noticed was that this in equitable enforcement was causing her and me a tremendous amount of stress.  At one point I couldn’t stand being around her because she just had no regard for rules or boundaries.  Me and my wife have discussed this before and have fought about it before, my plea to my wife has been we need to set rules and enforce them equally and that me being the enforcer constantly is effecting my relationship with my daughter, not because what I am telling her is wrong, but because she thinks dad doesn’t like her or love her when rules are enforced.  This past week I lost it with my wife and my frustration grew with her inaction and in my mind I felt alone, ignored to the point where I wanted to just run away.

3. She is more fun to be around, she helps with clean up and knows she has a role to help and contribute

,Parenting,"TL;DR: 11 year old son and I watch the show Grey's Anatomy together, with necessary precautions. I'm still concerned that I may be messing him up (though there aren't any signs for that). Plus, 2 episodes with tough topics are coming up, which he will want to see, but I'm not sure if I should let him. 

I'm going to put the Media flair on this, but feel free to change it if it doesn't fit.

So, I have 4 kids, age 14, 11, 9 and 2. I also have a favorite show, Grey's Anatomy. It's a medical drama centered around the lives of about a dozen young doctors, their personal lives and their careers. It is not a children's show and I know this.

My 11 year old son watches it with me. Let me explain how that happened. A few months ago, I was doing a re-watch of the show and was almost done with season 10 (which is where I always stop). It was 10pm or something, and my son was in the kitchen finishing up his math homework. 

From the kitchen table, you can see the living room and the TV. Since my son hates math, he obviously started watching the show rather than doing his math after a while. Eventually, he came over and started watching it with me a little bit. He asked about the characters, what was happening, and so on. He really liked it, especially when it had a few really emotional and wholesome moments later in the episode. So, naturally, he asked if he could continue watching with me. I told him I would think about it. 

That night, I considered it. The thing I was most worried about was the blood and the surgery scenes, but I also remember seeing non-child-friendly stuff on TV as a kid and it didn't harm me. I thought maybe he'd forget about it, but he didn't, and I gave in. I told him he could start watching with me, a few weeks later, when I'd be done with that re-watch and start with season 1 again.

I made a few conditions for watching. Obviously we only watch it together, since that's ""our thing"" from now on. The other thing was that I would be warning him when I knew something bloody would come up, and ask him to close his eyes. He mostly does that, unless it's a really cool surgery he wants to see and he's certain he can take it. We also skip episodes where I think that the topic itself is too much to handle. That hasn't happened often yet. And we discuss decisions that characters make, because they're all likeable but make bad decisions sometimes, and I want him to reflect on that. He's good at that and enjoys the discussions.

Here comes my issue. First of all, I'm still worried that I'm doing something wrong. On one hand, I'm pretty sure I handle it well, but on the other hand, I don't want to, you know, mess him up on accident.

The second thing is that we are at the beginning of season 3 now, episode 5. Episode 15 and 16 are 2 very amazing episodes, but they handle tough topics. A disaster happens, a &gt;!ferry boat accident!&lt;, and in the episode after, the main character Meredith  has a tragedy happen to her: She &gt;!nearly drowns, has a near-death experience and is brought back to life. It is basically a suicide attempt, but not really, since she didn't intentionally jump into the water, she just gave up on trying to swim back up.!&lt; These are the kinds of episodes I would like to skip.

Here comes the issue, though: He will want to see them. Especially once I tell them what they are about (which I will). He will assure me that he can handle it. I don't want to ban him from watching if he really wants to, and I don't want him to just watch them in private without my knowledge, because then I can't be there and talk to him about it. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I know these episodes well, and I would know when to tell him to close his eyes, that's not the issue, it's just the topic and the overall tension itself, I guess.

What should I do? Should I just let him watch and handle it the same way I always do? Should I not let him watch and explain why? If so, how would I help him through his disappointment? The episodes are not super plot relevant, it works if I just fill in the blanks later on, but I've seen them and know he'd be missing out. Am I overthinking this? Or do you think he's just too young for the show altogether?

I appreciate all of you guys' opinions and will gladly answer any further questions you may have regarding the situation. I guess I'm just concerned, as this is for sure one of my more ""questionable"" parenting choices.

**Edit:** So far, everyone has been telling me it's fine. Thank you so much, guys, you have alleviated my worries. I love watching this show with him and now I think I can be a little more relaxed about it. I will watch season 3 episode 15 and 16 with him.

Plus, 2 episodes with tough topics are coming up, which he will want to see, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I should let him. &lt;/p&gt;

My little girl is coming up on 9 months and is doing really well but I’m starting to get quite down about the comments I’m getting as I’m still breastfeeding.

This is for a few reasons- 1. She absolutely hates the hypoallergenic formula (don’t blame her, it’s disgusting), 2. It’s easy to control her intake and make sure there’s no cross contamination and 3. Nutritionally, this is the best thing for her. 

My breastfeeding journey hasn’t really been supported at all from the beginning by people around me, my MIL is a nightmare about it and even though my SO sticks up for me, I’m constantly hearing stupid comments from her and that whole side of the family. I don’t get why there is such a stigma attached to it. I’m feeding her what’s best for her, she’s growing well and by that point, I’ll be exclusively pumping so what is the problem? If it’s not them, it’s other friends telling me how hard it’s going to be to pump at work and I just don’t want to be beaten down by it constantly, the negativity just doesn’t help.

So here's some context. Our son (12 ) is on the high functioning side of the spectrum with some depression/anxiety issues.

,Parenting,"Hi parents!

New parent here to a wonderful 3 months old redheaded boy who I absolutely love.

My wife and I are a bit worried we will ruin our child's sleeping behavior.

Currently, he sleeps in our bed with us, at the edge of the bed (secured, of course), my wife in the middle and me to the side. We have a crib but our bed is shorter than the crib, so we can't see him from our bed, and so we felt safer to have him sleep with us. He also sleeps better this way. 

Usually, most nights his ""long sleep"" for the night starts at around 9 or 10 and usually lasts between 3-4 hours, then the next sleep after feeding/changing is about 2-3 and then another 2-3. Sometimes longer sometimes shorter.

We found out recently that the FASTEST way to get him to sleep is to put him in a carrier on one of us - he usually falls asleep this way within 10 minutes (as opposed to an hour+ it usually takes when we're trying to get him to fall asleep in bed). After he falls asleep in the carrier for like an hour (during which we relax and watch TV or something), we very gently move him to bed and go to bed ourselves.

Are we endangering his sleeping behavior by getting him to fall asleep ""easily"" in the carrier? I'm worried this will be the only way he falls asleep and I don't want to ruin him this way. 

On the other hand, when he's fussy and cranky and not calm, we can get him to calm down and sleep fast in the carrier - why should I let him suffer?

We won't ruin anything long-run if we keep getting him to sleep mostly in the carrier.. right?

Oh, I didn't mention but, obviously due to COVID-19 we don't even get to take him on walks. I was told around 5-6 PM is when many babies get antsy, and taking him on a stroller walk helps them, but we can't do that right now.

Sorry for the wall of text, I really love the hell out of him and don't want to mess up.

,Parenting,"My 9 year old daughter has been having some extreme behaviors as of late. I am sure some of it has to do with the current state of the world but we have always had issues with behavior. She was adopted when she was 2 years old and has some disordered attachment issues. She has been in therapy on and off since age 2 and has been seeing her current therapist since the start of the school year. 

Last night the kids decided to cook dinner for mother's day. My wife and I were in the bedroom and went out to see what was going on when we heard crying. We discovered that the 9 year old had dropped some of the food on the ground. Our 6 year old ended up saying something like ""Oh, no"" but the 12 and 13 year olds went over to help her clean it up. No one yelled at her but she started crying and apologizing. My 6 year old made a comment that she didn't realize was a little snarky and that really set the 9 year old off. She started screaming and ran up to her bedroom. I tried to coax her down for dinner but she said she wanted to stay in her room. We waited for a half an hour and she didn't come out so we told her we were going to start eating. She came downstairs, saw us eating, and that triggered a whole new meltdown. She couldn't believe we were eating without her. I explained why but it didn't matter to her in that moment. My wife and I ended up allowing her to sleep in our bedroom last night. We talked about what happened and she seemed better. 

This morning she had another meltdown after I told her it was time to come inside so she can do her school work. She was on the trampoline with our 13 year old and he came inside as well but she refused. She just laid on the trampoline screaming at the top of her lungs and crying. I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbors called child protective services. Good thing they know us well because she sounded like she was being abused. She ended up not doing her Zoom meeting with her class and is still refusing to do the work. Even my 13 year old who normally fights me over school work has been trying really hard today in hopes that the 9 year old will follow along. It hasn't been successful.

She’s regressing and is woefully addicted to electronics at way too young of an age because we are struggling to watch her and work at the same time. It’s horrible and I feel horrible. She’s started using baby talk for some reason and just gets obsessed with things and whines incessantly. 

-I am currently smack in the middle of treatment for Lyme disease.

My job is super light but I’m still having trouble keeping up due to feeling so bad. Let alone giving my daughter the attention she needs. 

-my husband is slipping in his job performance because it is literally phone based and our daughter tries to get his attention all day. We don’t have an office or a desk in another room or anything so he can’t lock himself away.

,Parenting,"My girlfriend is pregnant. We didn't plan it. We were only a few months into our relationship; to be honest, we barely even know each other that well. We should have been safer, but we got unlucky, and here we are.

She's always wanted to be a parent and has taken things in stride. Part of me suspects she may have even been angling for this, but that's another story, I guess.

Me on the other hand, I have taken things poorly. I""ve been adamant against kids most of my life, and while I might have softened a tiny bit recently, I absolutely don't want to have one right now. But I'm no longer in a position to make that decision. My girlfriend wants to keep it, of course, that's her choice to make.

The relationship was pretty great to start, but a few months is also not anywhere close enough to make a lifetime commitment.

I'm trying to be supportive but feel as if I'm failing. The relationship has already taken a hit, given the tension our different opinions have caused. I'm borderline devastated when I start thinking about the opportunity cost of the next 20 years. I am going to try to get some professional help because I don't know what else to do. 

I know I'm going to have to step up to my responsibility, but if I do that with resentment, it's hard to see how things can be good.

Has anyone been in this situation, and had it work out well in the end?  Is there anything positive that you could tell me?

So, we have a kid. He is 11 years old. He is born in Iceland, but have lived in Norway for the past 9 years. He has family he visits once-twice a year. His mother is also Icelandic, and does speak icelandic with him. He chooses to communicate in norwegian and prefer it that way. 

I'm his bonusmom, I do not speak icelandic. I understand some though. So at home we speak norwegian together. (His mom is my partner.)
He speaks norwegian at school and everywhere else really.

His maternal grandparents (who also live in Norway) is giving him and his mother a hard time because of him not speaking icelandic. They have tendencies to complain a lot to his mom (he is not eating healthy enough, he has to much screentime, he is to fat, he is not speaking enugh icelandic etc) and we are sick of it. He is a healthy kid, with normal weight and has a good diet (they see him in the weekends and school holidays, and at those times he will get some candy, but no more than other kids). He also prefers norwegian.

We would probably be more on him, with learning bretter language when it comes to icelandic. But, he has dyslexia and we are struggling with basic skills in norwegian and english, which is the two languages he has at school. At school he is receiving extra help with learning to read and write better. At home this means 45 minutes arguing before he does his homework. Therefore we don't want to push him, when it comes to learning icelandic. 

I have reached out to professionals, asking them what we can do about the situation..but what do you guys think? Should we force the language on him or tell the grandparents to shut up? 

We believe that forcing him will only make it harder. For now he has interest in learning icelandic through some apps for younger children and he does talk a bit with his mom. His paternal grandparents live in Iveland. As well as his father, some aunts and uncles and cousins. None of them make a big deal and they do understand each other, even when it's a mix of icelandic, norwegian and danish. 

His maternal grandparents do not say anything about his cousin here in Norway, who do not say a word in icelandic. He just refuse, because he lives in Norway. He understand, but do not talk.

,Parenting,"My husband and I have been together for 9 years. In the beginning, I got along really well with his mother. She was really determined to make me feel like part of the family. Honestly, she's a wonderful lady who raised an awesome son (she has two other sons, who are cool too) and has great intentions for everyone. She volunteers, makes kickass crafts, and is overall a very generous and giving person. And yes, it's from a genuine desire to help, which is amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER.

&amp;#x200B;

When my husband and I got engaged a few years back, things started to change. Lots of backhanded comments, passive-aggressive insults thinly veiled as jokes, and outright put-downs (you're JUST his wife, I'm his mother). We got pregnant shortly after our wedding, and now I'm an expectant mom with an increasingly long list of fears and worries, most of which related to my MIL and her behaviour once the baby is born. The thing is, I can see she's a good person with good intentions who wants good things for me, my husband, and for our baby, but my experience with her over the past few years has been increasingly peppered with negativity. She has VERY strong opinions about how things should be done (what people wear, how mealtimes should work, how mothering should be, etc.), and when things are not done her way she has very specific responses: 1. make a snarky comment and does not let you forget that she's seriously judging you, 2. tell you you're doing everything wrong and trying to do it for you. My husband does NOT notice when she does these things. She outright called me a bitch in front of EVERYONE because I was doing better than her at a card game during one of our weekly visits, and no one flinched until I called her out and told her that that was inappropriate. Then my husband was quick to support me, but again he does not pick up on when she is being rude when she does it. Most of the time when I call her out, she tells me I'm being overly sensitive OR that I'm being disrespectful by not taking the ""joke"".

&amp;#x200B;

She did this A LOT with the wedding, even though she kept saying that she knew it isn't her day, and that she had hers, which makes me worry that it'll be the same with parenting. I want her to be a part of my daughter's life, especially since they live so close, because as a kid my relationship with my grandparents was so important to me. But I also want her to give me the space I need to learn how to do this whole parenting thing, privately. Because I know I'm not going to be great at everything off the bat, but I can't get better if she just steps in and tries to do everything for me. I want to go through the embarrassing parts of learning to breastfeed, for example, with just me and my husband, but she wants to be super involved with that too. Add the MAJOR differences in opinions (she thinks I should only breastfeed, whereas I want to pump and let my husband do some of the feeling), and I'm just really stressed out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that some of this is her wanting to help and doing it the only way she knows how, and some of it might be stemming from insecurity because I tend to get the princess treatment from her husband and sons. I was raised in an all girls household, so I try to include her as much as possible, because girl power. She has admitted that she always hated spending time with other girls/women because she never felt she was the center of attention (this also worries me, because I'm expecting a daughter. there have been more than a few comments about how baby girls are manipulative b\*\*\*\*es, mostly in a joking context, but it just gets to me). I get that she was the only woman in the house and that it's hard to share the spotlight, but I'm not the type that just wants to storm in and take the show. I just want to exist and have a place too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's been going on for a while, but it's all coming out now because yesterday was mother's day. We drove an hour to go get her some KFC because it's her tradition, and then sat outside in the cold so we could have a socially distanced visit. My husband mentioned that I had received a lot of well wishes, and she felt the need to emphasize that I don't count yet. She had made this very clear to my husband, who, not knowing any better since he's new to this parenting thing too, took her word for it and did not do anything special for me for mother's day. I'm aware opinions are split on this, so I didn't make a big deal of it and just treated myself for the day. He felt SO bad when I got a lot of calls and messages though, wishing me a happy mother's day and insisting that I count, so he ended up doing a lot of little things to make my day easier (massage, dishes, cleaning, fancy mocktails, etc.). I know he's probably going to beat himself up over it in secret, and I feel terrible for him.  


TL;DR - My MIL and I have VERY different views on motherhood (and also other things), and when our views are not the same she makes demeaning comments or tries to take over and do things for me. I'm worried she'll try to do this with my baby, and that I won't get to take my space as a mom because of it. I want what's best for my little girl, and I want to do what I can to salvage my relationship with my MIL too, but I am so tired of being put down and refuse to let her dictate how to live my life and raise my child.

Recently, our city has begun lifting the restrictions, and a few of our neighbors (who seem eager to get their kids and themselves out of the house) have just been letting their kids roam the neighborhood, often unsupervised. They now come to our house multiple times a day asking for our kids to play.

Here's the dilemma: we want our kids to have friends down the street, and we want to have good relationships with neighbors...and we want to help everyone to be safe! We do not seem to share similar philosophies with these parents on how to handle physical distancing.

How are you handling the conversations with neighbors and friends?

We did this separation due to myself being active duty military, soon to be retired. Anyway, main point is she has been away for going on 3 months or so now. She is alone and lonely in a new place. Naturally, her being out of state there isn't a lot the kids can do for her on Mom's Day. 

I feel as though my kids are old enough to know that they need to do SOMETHING for their Mom on Mother's Day. They are 18 and 16 years old. They did nothing. They didn't even call their mother. For the majority of the day I was either video chatting with my wife or on speaker with one another (it's how we spend time together being apart) and they did not utter one word to her. My daughter actually decided to spend the time with her boyfriend's family for 12 hours...she simply sent a text to my wife ""Happy Mother's Day, Mom."" 

I know this upset my wife because she kept casually bringing up that the kids hadn't called her. My wife went to bed about an hour and a half ago, my 16 year old is still sitting on the floor with a VR helmet on and my daughter came home 20 minutes ago with her boyfriend and is spending more time with him.

Now, I am step-dad, so the situation is a bit tricky. If you've ever been in a step-parent position, you know how I'm feeling. I don't want to over-step my bounds, but I am pretty angry and disappointed at them for not even trying. They are not bad kids, they are actually pretty damn great and well-behaved. Not trouble makers in any sense...but still, this bothers me. I think what bothers me the most is knowing my wife is hurting because all she wanted was a call from the kids. 

I guess I'm asking, how do I go about approaching this without losing my temper or sounding like a big ass? Thanks for your time.

But the change that has come to affect my present is heartbreaking.  Of all the hard days of the COVID-19 quarantine this one was by far the worst- Mother’s Day 2020.

Any other year I would have been in the kitchen cooking for a crowd.  Listening to the chatter closely but from afar was my specialty and most of the time I didn’t mind.  There was a sweet spot for Mother’s Day not that long ago.  A time where my grandmothers were both living and my children were born.  A time when four generations were bustling under one roof.  In those years I proudly took the backseat to the matriarchs.  

My babies are no longer babies. My marriage is no longer in tact. My grandmothers are no longer with us.  Motherhood has taken on a different shape one of which I am not longer familiar or comfortable. Teenagers are hard.  I have become the enemy.   

Today, I sat alone in my once full home.  My girls 17 and 14 went with their Dad to visit his mother who they hardly see.  That left me alone. My only visitor for most of the day was my Mom. I was glad to sit and talk to her after two months of isolation.  However, it just wasn’t the same. Didn’t feel at all like a celebration. 

I will have to wait for grandchildren to ever again see handmade cards, macaroni drawings, or hugs.  Those days are gone.  I miss being called “Mom” without it being huffed, bellowed, or followed by an eyeroll, sigh, or request for money.  I can’t lie, I do miss the hugs and the eye contact.  I miss being treated like anything but a nuisance or as exciting as a pebble in their Nike!

Social distancing would have made the perfect alibi today, but a fallible one.  Honestly I am not sure which was more lonely- actually being alone or the forty five minutes with my mother and daughters where I might as well have been alone.

With no other family to hide behind, the crisis  loudly exposed our brokenness.  Maybe they don’t care, but all I saw was that I was worth less than an hour of my daughters’ time. As soon as my Mom said she was leaving my 17 year old’s keys were in hand to go back to her Dad’s ( I’m the enemy, remember?).

I’ve been with my boyfriend for just a year and we have a baby on the way. In that year he’s been unfaithful and verbally/physically abusive towards me. Even while pregnant he has abused me once. He has a horrible temper I can admit that. He’s cussed me out in front of my son, has yelled at my son, pushed him down(on accident) and even pinched him. I told him straight don’t put your hands on him &amp; he’s apologized and said he won’t do it again.

My son can be a handful but most kids are, you as the adult should not let it get to you and just brush it off. He just doesn’t get it. It’s been about three months since the last time he was physical with me (on Valentine’s Day I might add). I was 3 months pregnant, i won’t go into much detail on that but it was traumatizing. It always is. This was also the night he pushed my son down. The day after he was super apologetic and saying he wanted to kill himself yada yada. I chose not to break up with him because i wanted my children to have a family and see if we could work it out. I’ve tried to forgive him and move on and have a healthy relationship but I can’t forget all that’s happened In the past year.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for just a year and we have a baby on the way. In that year he’s been unfaithful and verbally/physically abusive towards me. Even while pregnant he has abused me once. He has a horrible temper I can admit that. He’s cussed me out in front of my son, has yelled at my son, pushed him down(on accident) and even pinched him. I told him straight don’t put your hands on him &amp;amp; he’s apologized and said he won’t do it again. He says that he loves my son and i believe he does but also think he just doesn’t have the patience to deal with children. My son can be a handful but most kids are, you as the adult should not let it get to you and just brush it off. He just doesn’t get it. It’s been about three months since the last time he was physical with me (on Valentine’s Day I might add). I was 3 months pregnant, i won’t go into much detail on that but it was traumatizing. It always is. This was also the night he pushed my son down. The day after he was super apologetic and saying he wanted to kill himself yada yada. I chose not to break up with him because i wanted my children to have a family and see if we could work it out. I’ve tried to forgive him and move on and have a healthy relationship but I can’t forget all that’s happened In the past year. We had planned to move in together once the baby is born so we can be a family but I can’t help but think that all of his flaws will be amplified once we’re in a space alone “unsupervised”. I’ve just lost all trust for him. I want to believe he’ll do better but I’m not willing to risk me and especially not my children being hurt by him. So I just want to know, what would you do in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Hi Everyone

I'm not sure if this is just a rant or a request for some clarity (if anyone even has it), but here goes.

My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter. We also live only a half a mile away from my mother who is in her 70s. For obvious reasons we havent gotten close to her for 2 months. And I've been perfectly fine with that decision given what all of the experts have been saying. But lately I've been thinking about how damaging it might be for my daughter to effectively not see her grandma and other kids her age. 

She's just now entering an age where she's much more aware of things and from what I've learned about early childhood development, there are certain critical periods of learning where when you miss out on them it can effect you deeply. For instance if kids dont learn speech at a very particular time they cant ever learn to speak (it's an extreme example I get that, but just to set the table on my logic).

I'm starting to wonder how not seeing her grandmother for many months will effect her ability to have as wholesome and beautiful a relationship as I'd like. And I wonder how not playing with any other kids will effect her ability to socialize in the future. I'm thinking about these things lately because as more news comes out regarding the virus, it seems very likely that this is going to continue for a while. I say this because I keep hearing about fall and winter outbreaks and with the possibility of there being no real solace until a vaccine is out (which could take years if we're being honest).

My mother has had some health issues in the past that concern me. Nothing pertaining to respiratory issues, but certainly shes within the vulnerable population and so that's my primary concern like most of us. But I'm really wondering if the damage to my daughter and frankly to the relationship between her and my mother during her twilight years is worse than the relatively low chance of getting sick.

So I'm in this fork in the road now where I need to make a decision of waiting this out for potentially many more months or just opening our circle further. I'm at an impasse with watching the news. Im convinced that regardless of left or right you are getting information either meant to scare you irrationally or play it off as a non issue. I just wish I had a reliable resource to weigh these things and spit out the most reasonable rational guidance but it's missing for me and probably all of us.

So that's my rant. I'm sure there are other people out there thinking similarly and maybe best case scenario they can get some solace knowing that I'm equally as confused. But maybe someone out there can give me some good feedback on all of this.

So my little will have hist first session next week i'll be an evaluation then we'll have a paper that we must have signed by his pediatrician.

Then has to go back for a ear check up, we already did it 2 times and now we have to go again!!

The most shoking an IQ test, i just called and they told me he need to be 3 to be able to take a test. He'll be 3 next month so i took an appointment the day of his birthday...

All those cost and time lost, we already lost 2 months because of the lockdown we'll have to wait again to have everything settled before begining his speech therapy.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She explained how it&amp;#39;ll be and what we need to be able to be reimbursed by the national medical care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my little will have hist first session next week i&amp;#39;ll be an evaluation then we&amp;#39;ll have a paper that we must have signed by his pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then has to go back for a ear check up, we already did it 2 times and now we have to go again!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most shoking an IQ test, i just called and they told me he need to be 3 to be able to take a test. He&amp;#39;ll be 3 next month so i took an appointment the day of his birthday... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those cost and time lost, we already lost 2 months because of the lockdown we&amp;#39;ll have to wait again to have everything settled before begining his speech therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how will they make a IQ test on my son? &lt;/p&gt;

I woke up this morning, came downstairs, and there was a card on the dining room table for me from my husband. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but that’s all it was - a card that said Happy Mothers Day. He told me that because of the Coronavirus, nothing was open and he couldn’t get me a gift, which is completely untrue. Everything else went on like a normal day, too.

,Parenting,"I’m a single mother of 6 year old twin boys. In line with the current restrictions where I am I did what I could with wishing my mother a Happy Mothers Day and gave her a gift (actually there were a few gifts as there were two group presents for her and a personal gift from my twins and I to her). Then today (day after Mother’s Day) I realised that I wasn’t celebrated at all. Let me explain:

Due to my dad buying a large item (adult children were all chipping in for it) stuff with my mother occurred early (Dad didn’t want to load/unload/hide the item) so my boys were making Mother’s Day cards a week+ ago to give my mum with the gift I had bought her (they love giving their grandparents drawings). But because I had hyped up the fact we were going to be able to see their grandparents for the first time in weeks to give them the pictures they drew I fell to the wayside.

My sister would occasionally try to take the boys shopping for me (I’d give her some money and she’d supervise them picking out a gift for me for Mothers Day/Christmas) but she couldn’t do that this year.

And I realised that this is the first year they are in school to have created something for me that I wouldn’t have known about (the playgroup I took them to until they started kindergarten had parents supervising their own children with a coordinator who had set up various activities but didn’t supervise). 

My boys didn’t know it was Mother’s Day until last night when they questioned why I was making a “special” dinner for myself. (Twins wanted toasted cheese sandwiches, I decided to have eggs and hollandaise sauce on toast) 

Most of my siblings live with my parents so when I went over to give my gift to her/the twins to give her their drawings there were a lot of “Happy Mothers Day, Mum!” being said, along with “hope you like your presents, Mum!” directed at my mother, which is to be expected.

Yesterday on a group chat my nieces half siblings dad (convoluted I know) wished my brother a “Happy Mothers Day/Single Fathers Day”. 

The only “Happy Mothers Day” comment directed towards me was by my mother as I was leaving her house after giving her the gift and pictures. 

Logically I know it’s not my family’s responsibility to wish me a Happy Mothers Day, but I can’t help but feel a little down now thinking that I had subconsciously been a bit excited hearing about what the school does for Mothers/Fathers Day knowing the twins could do something to surprise me this year that I didn’t already know about or had to organise (like in the case of my sister taking the twins shopping, I had to drive them to meet up).",t2_54sn666j,False,,0,False,Feeling down about Mothers Day,"[{'e': 'text', 't': '🐣 Spring Holidays'}]",r/Parenting,False,6,spring,0,False,t3_ghgn8g,False,light,0.83,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},🐣 Spring Holidays,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589199643.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Parenting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a single mother of 6 year old twin boys.

,Parenting,"Long story short, we were having an argument (one that occurs too regularly, and has never quite come to resolution) about how things get done around the house. I was attempting to make dinner, 5mo was also hungry, husband was online gaming and didn't want to help feed baby until after he was done. I got frustrated and he didn't understand why, while also asking when dinner would be done.
Somehow our sex life got brought up (probably because it's nonexistent) and he said he hasn't touched me in weeks or shown affection because I emasculate him by asking him to help with our baby. Caring for a baby by feeding, bathing, or changing isn't something that comes naturally to men.

Some background - I am a stay at home mom by choice, and I thought I was doing a pretty good job of it, while also showing my husband appreciation for giving me the opportunity to be at home raising our son. He also wanted me to stay home. He works construction, so hard labor most days and is usually exhausted when he gets home. Our routine is that he holds the baby after work and they nap together on the couch so I can do things around the house or, once a week, go grocery shopping. Besides that I am the sole caretaker. But that was something he said he's tired of doing, too. It might sound like I'm being high and mighty, but I swear I can only think of twice in my son's life that I have asked my husband to take over for me so I could do something for myself, and it caused such an argument the last time that I haven't asked since. There was one time in the last month that he offered to take him because I was at a breaking point and in tears. 

He's not a terrible father. He likes to play with our son sometimes and is the best at making him laugh. He'll read a book to him if I ask him to. He's clearing out the garage for a place for them to do things together when our son is older. He keeps saying things will change when our son is older and can listen and understand him. That he'll be a better dad to him then because he can interact with him more. I guess I just worry that the disconnect will be too much to repair once he is old enough, and that all he'll know of his dad is a man who makes money for us to live on.

I guess I just needed to vent to some other parents because I don't want to talk to friends or family about this. I don't want to put him in a bad light to them. I want to look into counseling, but I don't even know if that's something he would agree to.

,Parenting,"Hey all, first time posting here.... I apologize for the lengthy post. TLDR down at the bottom.

   I have gotten *some* advice from my own therapist, and also look forward to getting advice from my son's (relatively new) therapist. However, I wanted to outsource this question and get some more help from a larger group. Maybe some of you will have been in this situation before.  


   I (28M) have a son who is almost 6 years old. Mother and I have been apart since just before his first birthday, so a split home is normal for him. (We both had joint legal custody since 2016).  
  

   The last 5 years has been absolute hell on Earth. I try my hardest to shield and hide the issues surrounding his mother and I, but I am not always able to. I cannot erase his memories of his mother beating on me, and I cannot take-back the time when his mother explained what a restraining order is, and why Mommy can't come near Daddy.... or why Daddy ""keeps throwing Mommy in jail"". I have tried my hardest to keep the literal **constant** litigation out of his world.  


   Just before the holidays last year, my child disappeared from school and was not seen for 2 weeks. To make a long and miserable story short, Mother decided to take our child, flee out of state, file for custody in a different state (without jurisdiction), and started planning to flee the country and kidnap our child, never to be seen again.  
 Why would Mother do this? She has developed some serious mental health issues and has fallen delusional that the government is ""out to kill her"" and the courts are ""corrupt"" and numerous 3-letter agencies are conspiring to sell our son into a human trafficking ring.  
  

   After the 9th day of our son being missing, I worked with 5 police departments to track him down. He was found - safe - with his Mother and Step Father. After the police got involved, Mother brought him back and returned to Home State. Once he was returned, information was provided to me through various law enforcement agencies about the plans to flee the country with our child. I immediately moved for emergency custody, and our son has been living with me for 5 months now.  
  

   Mother was restricted to supervised visitation for 4 hours a week. This of course was a huge change for the little guy, and he naturally asked questions such as ""Why can't I go back to Mommy's house?"" or asking (in his own words) why he could only see Mommy at that [supervised center]? These were some really tough questions to answer. I had to walk a fine line, because I did not want to have to explain what is really going on. I refuse to openly disparage his mother in front of him, or speak ill about her in any way, shape or form. I also have been told many times, to not lie to him..... So, I would tell him half-truths. I would go on to tell him that ""Mommy just needs some help right now, and needs time to get some things sorted out. So you're going to come live with me for awhile so she can get some things like (school) and (work) done.""  
  

   Well eventually, after only a few visits, his Mother stopped showing up all together to come visit him at the supervised center. The first 2 times, I got there and the staff told me she wasn't there yet and she hadn't called to explain where she was. So they cancelled the visits. Seeing the look on my son's face when we drove all the way up there to see Mommy, only to be told she hadn't come, broke my heart. He was so sad and confused and cried and cried.  
  

   *I lied for her.* Despite letting our son down, I lied to our child to make it look like she wasn't a bad guy. I told him the first time, that Mommy must be having some car trouble and she is having a bad day. The second time, it was really snowy out so I told him that Mommy wasn't able to make it because the weather outside. And that is is dangerous, and it's a good thing that Mommy stays home and is safe, because Mommy might get into a car accident or stuck in the snow.  
  

   Soon after, she just stopped coming all together and the center cancelled all visits. On the third and final no-show, I was so angry at her. I decided not to cover for her. Our son realized Mommy cancelled and didn't come to see him, and I didn't have it in me to lie for her any more. He cried and went on to say he ""doesn't think Mommy wants to see him anymore."" I held him tight and broke down like a baby. I could feel his pain, and I was so saddened to know that deep down in his heart, he felt like she no longer cared about him.  
  

   That was 3 months ago. She fled the state to avoid getting arrested on a warrant. Since then, when he asks about his mother, I tell him that ""Mommy loves him very much and misses him every day. And that she is taking care of things back in her home state and will return someday, hopefully soon.""  
  

   Earlier this week, I was granted sole physical and legal custody of our son. I also learned that Mother was finally apprehended on her warrants after she started sending death threats to me, her mother, the detectives on the case, and many others. I cannot begin to express the feelings I hold inside.... I am immensely happy, I am relieved, stressed out from fighting, and tired. I look forward to a brighter future.  
  

   However, I am stuck. I have won full custody of our child, and I don't know how to even begin to explain this to him. I eventually have to discuss the changes with him, and why he will be living with me from here on out. His mother is likely to be extradited back to our home state, and stand trial for a felony charge (among other charges). She may go to jail for quite some time..... Do I explain to him that his Mother is in jail? In the past, I avoided telling him about her being in jail because it was only a few days and I didn't think he needed to be aware of that. But now, she may be sentenced to do some time and may go away for a few months.  
  

   I'm at a loss and I am in over my head. I know that I *have* to start giving him explanations, but I don't want him to think his mother is bad person. (I mean, she is a massive piece of shit to me, but her relationship with him was always strong and warm. She just screwed up alot by trying to put our child in the middle of everything and trying to turn him against me). I don't know what to do anymore or what to tell him. I need some help from some of you.

Since then, when he asks about his mother, I tell him that &amp;quot;Mommy loves him very much and misses him every day. And that she is taking care of things back in her home state and will return someday, hopefully soon.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I was granted sole physical and legal custody of our son. I also learned that Mother was finally apprehended on her warrants after she started sending death threats to me, her mother, the detectives on the case, and many others. I cannot begin to express the feelings I hold inside.... I am immensely happy, I am relieved, stressed out from fighting, and tired. I look forward to a brighter future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am stuck. I have won full custody of our child, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to even begin to explain this to him. I eventually have to discuss the changes with him, and why he will be living with me from here on out. His mother is likely to be extradited back to our home state, and stand trial for a felony charge (among other charges). She may go to jail for quite some time..... Do I explain to him that his Mother is in jail? In the past, I avoided telling him about her being in jail because it was only a few days and I didn&amp;#39;t think he needed to be aware of that. But now, she may be sentenced to do some time and may go away for a few months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a loss and I am in over my head. I know that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to start giving him explanations, but I don&amp;#39;t want him to think his mother is bad person. (I mean, she is a massive piece of shit to me, but her relationship with him was always strong and warm. She just screwed up alot by trying to put our child in the middle of everything and trying to turn him against me). I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore or what to tell him. I need some help from some of you.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Mom lost custody after trying to kidnap the kid and flee the country. Mom loves kid, kid loves Mom. Need help explaining the changes to kiddo&amp;#39;s life without making Mom out to be a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t expect to be called mom or step mom or anything like that. But something my partner at work yesterday had me bawling and now as I write about it, it’s making me cry. As we were leaving work he told me ‘Have a happy Mother’s Day.’

So many conflicting feelings. First, sweetest thing ever. Second, saddened that someone who has a kid, and a wife who is also a step mom to that kid, sees all the work that I do, and gave me some recognition that I don’t feel like I get from my own family and thus makes me incredibly saddened. 

I haven’t had a mom since I was 12. So I feel like I’m missing out on all the things as a daughter I wanted to do with my mom. One of my goals in life is to be a better parent than mine we’re and to get to do those things with my own kid someday. So Mother’s Day really sucks, and I’m probably projecting all my feelings on to this.

Update: While I was asking her if I could refer to her as my daughter, she’d asked me why I never gave up on her. She and I had a horrible relationship when her dad and I first got together. I told her because I loved her and she was a critical person in my life, and that because of that love of never stop trying to make things work between us. 

Whelp all of that must have paid off. She came up to me just now and told me ‘It just occurred to me, you’re like my mother and I haven’t wished you Happy Mother’s Day yet.’ 

I’m now bawling like a baby. I have the sweetest and best kid ever. Step parenting is heart breaking, aggravating, and sometimes devastating. But when it goes right, the love and affection you receive from a kid who accepts you as a parent, the love and bond you’ve built is the most rewarding thing ever. I think my life is complete now.

,Parenting,"Recently, my 6yr old son has kinda regressed in his toilet use. He first started peeing in the tub, we told him not to do that and only pee in the toilet. Then he peed in a bucket I used for handwashing clothes, we did the same thing and made him clean it up. He then peed in the bathroom trashcan. Now were getting frustrated and making him clean it and taking things away. He comes up with some dumb reasons he does this and lies the first few times we ask. Today he peed without lifting the toilet seat getting it all over the place. His reason was he saw poop on the toilet seat (there was none) then he said the seat wouldn't stay open, so my husband thinks hes just getting lazy and peeing however he wants.

She’s 10 months and standing on her own, learning to have fits, etc, so it’s new to me and endearing. I can’t help but laugh when I say “no!” and she does whatever she wants anyways! I’m sure that will wear off soon.

Anyways.

I took my phone out to record her cuteness, while trying to shoo her away from the cables.

Well. I shooed her away and she lost balance. She conked her head against the windowsill and cried for several minutes with an extremely high pitched scream.

If I hadn’t been trying to record her I don’t think it would have happened. Now I feel ultra guilty for hurting my kid on the day that’s supposed to celebrate what a “wonderful” mom I am!

In other words, now I feel like I don’t deserve to be celebrated. 

I’m sure I’m being dramatic, but for whatever reason, every small thing that happens to her affects me in a very big way. The last time she got hurt because of me was a few months ago and I’m still not over that. I honestly think I never will be.

,Parenting,"Hello fellow redditors, and Happy Mothers Day to all!

So this morning, our 5-year old daughter said some hurtful things to my wife. They were playing together, and my daughter wanted to sing a song, but when my wife said she wanted to join in, my daughter told her, ""You're not a cool / amazing person, I don't want to sing with you."" And my wife exploded at her, and told her that she didn't like her, said some other disparaging things. Our daughter was very upset by these things, and slammed the door and came out crying.

I didn't hear the actual exchange, mind you (I was in another room) and I only heard a door slam from two floors down. I investigated, and found my daughter sitting at the top of the stairs with tears in her eyes. I asked her what happened, and she said that mom told her that she hated her. So I asked, what happened, and the little one wasn't willing to talk about it. So I decided that we should have the conversation later on, once everyone was calmed down.

My wife later came storming downstairs, in a really bad mood. I didn't think it would be helpful to open things up for discussion while tempers were still hot, so I decided to just go along with the normal routine. I tried to lighten the mood by suggesting I make something delicious for her, which she responded calmly to. 

Daughter and I then went downstairs to do a quick facetime with grandma to wish her Happy Mothers Day as well. Then came back up. Wife then exploded at both of us, saying that if she was going to be so disrespected, what was the point of her even being here, etc. And just going on a tirade.

So I sat down with daughter to get the whole truth about what happened. Took the calm, reasonable approach. Wife is sitting there interjecting herself into the conversation, yelling, going off. I asked her to stop, that this was not helping, but wife would not calm down and started to yell at me as well, telling me that the way I was handling things was wrong, and trying to forcefully make me agree with her. I told her that I was not going to have a conversation about parenting styles until everything was calmed down and we could discuss things like adults.

Wife then continued to disparage the way I was handling things in a loud voice, so I eventually just left the conversation because I didn't think it was helpful to disciplining our daughter to be having a screaming match in front of her. She kept saying we needed to force my daughter to apologize right then and there, and she also kept saying that I was complicit in my daughter's bad behavior by not punishing her on the spot in a big way. And she continued to try to lecture by yelling at me about it, so eventually I had enough and decided to walk out. I stayed calm throughout. 

So, anyway, I'm wondering how you all would suggest handling these kinds of situations. In my opinion, doing anything like that in the heat of the moment is not productive, as all it shows to our kid is that her parents, adults, handle things by lashing out and yelling at each other. 

But I am honestly curious about how others think. I know I'm pretty laid back when it comes to parenting, but was I wrong to handle things this way? How would you suggest handling situations like this?

And during labor which I had for 36hrs labor for my baby and she was commenting on FB as well to her friends how many cm was opened... i was so mad that she is sharing every single thing about my child birth. 

When I finally had my son, she stayed and watched me breastfeeding... I wasn't happy and she stayed almost all night after child birth and not leaving my baby alone with me and my husband. I was discharged the day after and she came over the next day with father in law at night around 10pm with beer and turned up the music(punk rock) so loud. I couldnt sit or stand because i was in so much in pain. My mom was worried because I was so stressed and lost so much weight after all that. My mother in law came almost every week to see him and I was still in pain.. I told my husband I don't want anyone in the house until I recover and my son is used to the new world. He agreed and he told his mom that I wouldnt want anyone... and even they come over, it will be before 6pm, no alcohol and no music!!! I heard she was crying because she wanted to see my son... I felt bad and she was making me a bad person and my brother in law was accusing me saying ""what did you do to my mom"". I was furious and I told them no more coming over until I said so!!

Few months later, she was asking more and more to bring him to her house and we did sometimes. COVID19 started and still she wants him out there to her house even when it was raining so hard. I asked her to come over instead and she said no because father in law is allergic to dogs..and we had a pug. She refused to come over and she said if we dont bring him to her house, she won't watch him for us while we go buy his food abs grocery shopping.. I had no choice to bring him to her house... and found out she gave him a bath without letting me know and she had NO towels, bath shampoo and lotion! Which I won't accept because I use separate towels only for him and his legs are dry so he needs lotion too...

My mother in law keeps trying to buy for my son which I appreciate but I want to buy him, not her. And things she buys for him is all about her and what she likes... not asking opinions and she does whatever she wants to do. She never let me hold him, change him or feed him when we are together and she even asked my husband to bring my baby over to her house and tell us to go shopping... 

I don't think she knows her place to be and give us space. She is all over to our family life and does not want to back up.. she even chewed on my baby's nails when he was a month old saying ""I chewed my son's nails when I had them"". I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU DID BACK IN YOUR TIME and she doesn't respect me to be a mother and it always have to be her way or else she will cry or not talk to me at all. 

I talked to my husband and he doesn't understand why I feel this way over my son... am I over reacting or do your mother in laws same as mine...? She makes me feel like she controls him and want to take him away from me...

,Parenting,"7 years ago I gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl, I was 17 at the time. 
My mom helped me with everything, but about 2 months after she was born I had a mental breakdown and told my mom I wanted to give her up for adoption. 
Because I was underage we got a third party to be her legal guardian who would give us advice and offer guidance where needed. She came and talked with me about how adoption could influence children and how staying with bio-parents would almost always be the best option.

I won't go into detail about everything that happend the next few years but my mom practically raised her from then on. 
There were times where I saw her twice every week but also times when I hadn't seen her for a month. 

When she was around 5 and she began to have play dates, and she was confronted with the fact that her home situation was different from the other kids, she began asking all kinds of questions about why she couldn't live with me and why I couldn't raise her ect. 

I've always tried to explain to her that I'm sick and it's in my brain and it has nothing to do with her, but I don't even fully understand it myself. 
I just can't and it hurts so much because I know it breaks her heart every time I leave after a visit. 

She even offered me money once so I would stay longer, like, what the hell am I supposed to say to that?

She has a very stable home living with my mom, stepdad and my little sister, she has a healthy relationship with her father and is with him 3 weekends of the month.

I just feel like her life would be less confusing/difficult if I wasn't there. 
I love her so much but I feel like I'm just hurting her by not being able to be there for her. 

About 6 months ago I had a pretty serious suicide attempt, I know she loves me, and it would destroy her if I died but I can't help to worry about the future.
Maybe it's better to leave while she still has happy memories of me, than give myself the opportunity to destroy even that.


Edit: First of all I want to thank everyone who took the time to read my post and commented to share their story or give some advice.

I hadn't been feeling very well and with mothersday coming up I was just very conflicted with myself. 

I'm happy to let you all know i have gotten back in contact with my therapist and got myself an appointment in a few days.

Hi all, want to see if I can get some opinions on what might be going on with my baby girl. She is 2.5 and I have a 3 month old. At first she was very sweet w her little sister, she would bring her toys and blankets, ask to hug and dance w her, it was adorable. We’ve been taking quarantine pretty seriously and she hasn’t been to her daycare or any social activities in weeks. 

Within the last week husband I have started to get worried. She shows no interest in her sister, doesn’t really respond to her name, bad eye contact (she still will just not when you ask or try to get her to). I used to be able to ask about her day and what we did, she would say go to park or whatever it was. Now, if she’s eating or busy it’s like she’s in her own world, she’ll look around or laugh at seemingly nothing. She’ll run around the room in circles laughing (just being silly?). She makes more none sense noises and she’s always been a great talker.

I’m worried she is on the spectrum, though she does seem to understand emotion. She loves her nephews but isn’t showing interest anymore when we FaceTime. She didn’t show interest in other kids at school (she was terrible at participating in group things). She does show concern when babies cry, so I know she understands emotion and she’s great with imaginative play and she’ll say things like are you okay? Or oh no! to her cartoons. So it could be more ADD. I can’t take her into the doctor bc they are only seeing little babies, I do have an appointment next week with my little one so I can ask then, just wanted to see if anyone else has seen a regression either because of adding a new child or this damn quarantine. She’s always been fiercely independent, but I just don’t feel like she’s my sweet girl anymore and I’m worried sick.",t2_yadp6,False,,0,False,Troubling Quarantine behavior,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Corona-Content'}]",r/Parenting,False,6,corona COVID covid,0,False,t3_gh4um7,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Corona-Content,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1589157984.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Parenting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, want to see if I can get some opinions on what might be going on with my baby girl.

,Parenting,"I am a father of a 7-month old. Like all the good fathers out there, I read a lot about how babies work, what to do with them and how to give them the best care I can. 

One of the many things I learnt while preparing for the little ones arrival:

No child under the age of 2 years old should watch TV. It may cause a lot of damage. Behavioural, social, psychological, you name it. Problems. It may also affect hearing and sight. 

I didn't like that. I searched for alternative opinions. Couldn't find anything from a good source. So my SO and I decided: no TV for our child, until he turns 2.

Fast forward 10-or-so months ahead and the situation is as follows:

Our baby is teething. He cries. He needs a lot of contact. Naps are practically gone: 1,5 hours a day these days. With work and commute, I am gone 10 hours a day. My wife is losing her mind.

So I come home one day and there he is, watching toddler cartoons. Calm. I ask my wife about it, she says that all of her mom friends let their kids watch TV. I ask her if this is necessary, since we know the possible consiquences. She says I don't know what it's like to be at home with a little baby all day, and that weekends doesn't count becouse then there's two of us taking care of him. I agree, but we still don't think TV is even remotely good option in a situation like this.

So my question goes as follows: are the harms caused by TV exaggerated, or should we continue this no-TV rule of ours? One of her friends said that all these studies are practically the same as if someone would say that smoking even a one cigarette could kill you.

She goes with him 3 Friday nights out of the month and for some reason, this one hurts. My heart is aching. I sobbed in my car after they drove away. I never thought I would be a single mom. I never thought I’d be in such a mentally and emotionally fucked up relationship that it was best to have my daughter have 2 homes rather than one. My heart aches for my baby girl never knowing what it’s like to have her family together. I just wish things could have been different. I wish he didn’t push me to hate him so much that I left. 

Usually, I hold it all together and I am just fine. I feel strong and empowered, but tonight- I just miss my baby and I am grieving for the thought of a family that I never really had anyways, but crave so bad. Being a single parent is so hard, so rewarding, and it’s beyond confusing at times. The nights are lonely at times...

&lt;p&gt;She goes with him 3 Friday nights out of the month and for some reason, this one hurts. My heart is aching. I sobbed in my car after they drove away. I never thought I would be a single mom. I never thought I’d be in such a mentally and emotionally fucked up relationship that it was best to have my daughter have 2 homes rather than one. My heart aches for my baby girl never knowing what it’s like to have her family together. I just wish things could have been different. I wish he didn’t push me to hate him so much that I left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, I hold it all together and I am just fine. I feel strong and empowered, but tonight- I just miss my baby and I am grieving for the thought of a family that I never really had anyways, but crave so bad. Being a single parent is so hard, so rewarding, and it’s beyond confusing at times. The nights are lonely at times...

&lt;p&gt;Anyone here experience the joys of &amp;quot;2 under 2&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

At Christmas, we got the ""it"" item this year, a pair of Google Nest Minis. As anyone with a ""home assistant"" knows, it doesn't take kids long to figure out how to use these things...

Since then, I've noticed my daughter (4) has started speakingmore rudely and abruptly:

* ""Daddy! Read me a book!""
* ""[Brother]! Stop!""
* ""Mommy! What time is it?""

And so on...

It took me embarrassingly long to realize she was mimicking how we speak to ""Google"", and how she commands it what to do. So in the last couple weeks, I've been making an effort to append ""please"" to the end of my commands, and sometimes I'll even just say ""Hey Google. Thank you!""

I am in a delima with my wife and stepson, and would love to get advice from others. 

So, my wife's son will be moving to college next April (we live in Japan), and she wants to move to same town as the college he will attend. I was explaining to her, I don't think it's a good idea since I think it's a great chance for him to experience freedom, independence and learn some responsibility.

She says she doesn't want to be far away from him, and wants him to visit during weekends. The problem is she and my stepson have a very strange relationship. My wife babies my stepson, and the he can't do anything for himself. He makes a mess around the house and expects me or her to clean it up. He even talks like a 5 year old,(in tone and way of speaking). It wasn't until my wife started giving him an allowance a few weeks ago that he started picking up his stuff (sometimes). He is going on 18, and I just find it weird that he is this irresponsible and childlike. He doesn't even have any interest in girls. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect him to know how to do everything, but simple things such as picking up clothes, or making a snack while we are at work seems pretty basic. It doesn't help my wife supports this. We got him a replacement Wii U and she wanted me set it up for him in his room. I explained to her, he should have to problem plugging two cords in, but she said it would be less stressful for him if I did it.

Whenever I try to discuss my concerns with my wife she gets angry, starts defending him and tells me I didn't raise him from a baby so you wouldn't understand. I understand that, but I just want to make sure he will be prepared for the real world. I have two friends who kind of failed at life, and now they stay at home jobless and playing video games. I've seen the pattern before and he is showing all the same signs. She also tells me that she and her son are one life and can't be apart from each other. This has also led into some other issues in our relationship, such as itimacy, lack of any romance, unwilling to do anything together if her son isn't with us. We've been married for 2 years, but dated 2 years 2 and a half years before that. 

He is a good kid, just really lazy, lacking motivation, and discipline. Since I can't seem to make any suggestions to him without the wife overruling my opinions, I've tried showing him how to be responsible through my actions. Making sure I keep the house tidy etc. When he was 12, it wasn't much of a concern since he was still somewhat a little kid, and I assumed overtime my wife would loosen up more as he got older, but things have only gotten worse.

Also, I should note if we didn't move, he would only be a 2 hour train ride from us. Which isn't bad for where we live in Japan.
Do you have an opinions own how I should approach this? No matter how nicely I try to bring it up she says ""I'm irritated, and tells me shutup"". She even recently told me she is willing to move to his area by herself. Which kind of tells me she doesn't value our relationship that much.

I'm honestly reaching the end of my rope, and even questioning if being in this relationship is worth it anymore, since I don't seem to have a voice in anything.

Any advice would be great.

,Parenting,"We've been shelter in place since mid March. Before SiP, we would put him down at 7:45, but he would roll around for 30ish minutes and actually fall asleep at 8:30. He would take a nap at daycare 12:30-2:30 but we usually let him sleep a little later, from 1-3:30/4.

Since shelter in place, though, he's progressively falling asleep later and later. We tried at first moving his bedtime back to 8. Then we started cutting back his nap time to 2 hours. But even then he's still awake, in his crib, rolling around or talking to himself. He seems tired and disregulated during the day, and angry when we wake him up from his nap.

Furthermore, he's been doing this annoying thing where he'll poop his diaper *after* we put him down for the night. Sometimes it's at 8:30, sometimes it's later at 9/9:15 but hes pooping at night every day for the past 2-3 weeks.  It almost feels like he's doing it on purpose to extend bed time.

,Parenting,"Hi, as the title suggests our female child who will be 7 at the end of May has been stealing, from her father and I. 

It started last year in April when we arrived at our new home (we had recently become a military family and arrived at my husband’s first duty station) she would go into our room and steal candy/snacks that we bought specifically for ourselves. 

Bear in mind (before Covid) her and her brother (almost 2) have always been given plenty of special days and treats, we semi regularly go out to dinner, to the arcade, the zoo, the mall where we spoil them with Build a Bear or The Disney store, clothing from various places, cinnabon etc depending on how they behaved/our budget etc. We don’t believe they were over spoiled this was usually a once per payday (every 2 weeks) thing and often was small (sometimes just a meal because we didn’t feel like cooking) and sometimes like during tax return/birthdays we got a little bit more extravagant.

We believed last year that we had nipped it in the bud, stuff stopped going missing, we stopped finding things gone through/touched, she started Kindergarten in August and was flourishing with school work, we got great reports from her teacher and the school staff, she made a “best friend” who is a sweet girl and a great influence. 

Well that was until about 2 weeks ago, stuff started going missing, getting moved around, handheld game systems found turned on/opened when we didn’t leave them that way, phones appeared messed with, however we chalked it up to forgetting (we have a 5 week old newborn and we’re all a bit frazzled from quarantine and are lacking sleep) and we had no proof. 

At that same time we had taken away her Nintendo DS (handheld game) due to not only poor attitude, her being unable to focus when we were speaking to her(she in general has a screen problem), general rudeness but also because she was caught more than once playing the system super late (11+ PM) at night or when she was told she could not play it. 

This week we caught her in our room 3 times and she lied(poorly) to our faces multiple times not only about why she was in our room (lies ranged from absurd to downright stupid) but what she had touched. 

We tried to calmly sit down and ask her why she was making this choice and she would only say things like “I didn’t think with my brain.” to “I was just being stupid.” to “I don’t know.” We gave her ample time to collect her thoughts and speak, we worked on breathing to calm down (as she was obviously crying having been caught) we let her know her answers would not affect her punishment as she was already in trouble but we wanted to understand why she made the choice so we could help her make better ones in the future but she gave us nothing to work with even when prompted with possible reasons for example “is it because you are mad we took your ds.” and “you were sad we told you you could not have ice cream because you refused to eats large part your dinner.”

We first took her toys with a warning books would be next, the second time as we warned we took her books with a very stern talking to her about choices and again gave her a chance to tell us why but she continued to spout nonsense answers and showed very little remorse other than what we determined were crocodile tears as she was upset she got caught but showed no remorse. She was left with only craft things like markers and coloring books. 

We discussed respect, we tried to make her understand how violated we felt, explained that our bedroom is the one room for just mom and dad to be alone, we asked if she would like if we went into her room, moved things, took her books or toys or special treats (she has Easter candy in her room) she stated that she would not like it and she would feel sad and mad if we did that to her. We really thought we had gotten through to her. 

We don’t love physical punishment plus spankings does not affect her at all so we told her we would be taking her birthday away if she went in our room again. We made sure to have a very thorough discussion about expectations, how her choices were her own and she had to set a good example for her brother and new baby sister. She seemed to understand and be very encouraged that they look up to her. 

Well just 1 day later she was in our room again, my husband who is 100% the calmer more permissive parent who defends our oldest to the death snapped, he not only spanked her but told her she lost her birthday and asked me to text/email grandparents to let them know we won’t be accepting gifts and that this was a joint decision we did not take lightly. 

My MIL called and basically helped us have a family talk on speakerphone (though I don’t like her at all  I was civil and heard her out) we agreed to give our daughter one more chance with the stipulation(outside of our daughters hearing) that if she messed up in the same way again mil will never stick her nose in again but she is certain she got through to our daughter as our daughter hates disappointing her nana. 

Our daughter did admit her reason for doing all this is “it’s unfair you have so much more than me.” We explained that we are adults who work in and outside the home, we have had more time to accumulate stuff as we are older and though we love her she is not an equal in this house and she needs to stop believing she is.

,Parenting,"Hey all,

Our 2.5 y/o daughter is usually pretty even tempered, but as of late she’s developed a new trait that we’re trying to nip in the bud. Whenever we eat, we each have our plates at the table. She straight up refuses to eat what’s on her plate, and points and screams and says “mommy/daddy sit”, implying that she wants to sit on our laps and eat our food. After nonstop screaming, we unfortunately cave, and she’ll eat all our food without letting us take a bite. Everyone has the same food on their plate, so it’s not a matter of us eating something tastier. 

Just now, my wife and I were having a banana ice pop, and we decided to give her one as a special treat. She took hers, and then shrieked endlessly for 15 minutes because she also wanted ours. This is before she even started eating hers. We tried swapping with her and the meltdowns continued. She just wants all of the food for herself, and none for us. I believe it’s a power thing, but I’m not sure of the best way to curb it. We just kept telling her “this is NOT okay. Everyone gets their own”, which didn’t seem to affect her state of mind at all.

&lt;p&gt;Our 2.5 y/o daughter is usually pretty even tempered, but as of late she’s developed a new trait that we’re trying to nip in the bud. Whenever we eat, we each have our plates at the table. She straight up refuses to eat what’s on her plate, and points and screams and says “mommy/daddy sit”, implying that she wants to sit on our laps and eat our food. After nonstop screaming, we unfortunately cave, and she’ll eat all our food without letting us take a bite. Everyone has the same food on their plate, so it’s not a matter of us eating something tastier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just now, my wife and I were having a banana ice pop, and we decided to give her one as a special treat. She took hers, and then shrieked endlessly for 15 minutes because she also wanted ours. This is before she even started eating hers. We tried swapping with her and the meltdowns continued. She just wants all of the food for herself, and none for us. I believe it’s a power thing, but I’m not sure of the best way to curb it. We just kept telling her “this is NOT okay. Everyone gets their own”, which didn’t seem to affect her state of mind at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips appreciated.. 😱😱&lt;/p&gt;

A couple years ago we moved down south from New England to be closer to my family. My husband had a difficult time adjusting.

,Parenting,"Our third child, a beautiful little girl, was born 5 days ago. I had an unremarkable pregnancy but the birth was a bit traumatic. As we were both healthy, we could go home a day later. 
Now, from the very start on, our daughter was a quiet kid. She sleeps a lot. We figured, she'd eventually wake up more and I enjoyed the sleep we'd get. As I said, this is my third child and I realize that every child is different. But this baby just sleeps. All day long and then all through the night. She will wake up, get a little restless and signal she wants  to be fed. If it doesn't happen soon, she'll cry but then stop after a while. Usually, I just feed her when she shows signs of hunger (or wake her up if she sleeps too long). She'll then nurse for a while and fall right back asleep. Nursing works fine as does her digestion. At five days, she's a little above her birth weight, so she's apparently getting enough. 

But other than right before feeding, she's never awake. She is awake with her eyes open for less than an hour a day. And it just doesn't get more. 
The pediatrician and the midwife that we asked both think that it's a little unusual but they're confident that she will eventually wake up more. Pediatrician also said to wait for the screening results (all babies here are screened for rare metabolic diseases like congenital hypothyreosis) but he doesn't think it fits any of the screened diseases since she feeds well.

She was also looked at by a pediatrician before we left the hospital and other than a failed auditory test on the right side (left side was fine) which they attributed to faulty equipment and which will be retested, soon, she was fine. No signs of heart trouble or jaundice. 

So while we wait for her to wake up a bit more, I just wanted to hear, other people's experiences. Has anybody had a newborn that was excessively sleepy? How did things turn out? When did they start to be more awake? Or have you found any other reasons why your kid slept so much? 

Thank you so much!

I had a pretty bad relationship with my ex but we had two kids together, it ended badly (my fault) and he subsequently hates me. It ended nearly 5 years ago and we have always struggled to co-parent, he’s aggressive and a narcissist which has had a huge impact on the kids. He’s essentially managed to alienate my daughter from me and our son has adhd so between the two it’s a lot. 
Everything came to a head about a year ago as I asked him to please stop bad mouthing me to the kids, they were confused and were telling me the things he’d said. I won’t go into it but there’s a lot of bad language included. 
He ended up losing his mind and refused to see the kids for nearly 2 months but before this he told them I was taking them away and they’d never see him again, so you can imagine how they acted when, low and behold, they were with me and weren’t seeing their dad. Even though I never have stopped them.

My daughter especially had a breakdown, she was 7 at the time, hitting, punching, kicking and biting me every day for taking her dad away. Of course I never bad mouthed him and just kept saying he just needs a bit of time. After a couple months of this he decided to see them again but by this time both kids decided they didn’t want to see me anymore because I’d kept them from their dad.

Finally managed to get them to come for weekends, obviously my heart is broken into a thousand pieces but I’m just trying to make their time here as nice as possible when they’re here. I honestly believe this isn’t parenting anymore, it’s just about enjoying them. Their behaviour is getting worse and worse, they’re rude, mean and spoilt.

When they are here for such a short time it seems there’s no point trying to put positive enforcements in place when they are at their dads so much. Help?&lt;/p&gt;

But once in a while we have a real tantrum and it’s as the title says.

Other times it’s something silly: doesn’t want to wait for us to finish eating to play or there are no more strawberries. 

He will cry till A) vomiting/panic attack B) he gets his way C) we open a stupid YouTube video for 10+ min.

,Parenting,"Hello, I have a situation and I would love some opinions on the subject.

I am a father of five children ages 3 to 14. I have been separated from my wife for over a year and a half. She had a boyfriend who sexually molested my oldest daughter. Because of that and her being suicidal the court ruled that I be granted temporary custody for a year. The court also stated that I am to supervise visits between her and the children. The problem is this woman hates me and does not respect the fact that the court-appointed me as the supervisor. On two separate occasions she has asked me for more time with them and when I told her that I am only giving her as much time as the court says she can have shes gets really angry. The first time she started yelling and insulting me and asking me to read the court paperwork all in front of the children. I told her to stop and that we could talk about this privately but she continued to yell and I said that if she didn't calm down I would have to take the children and cancel the visit early. She grabbed our three year old and told me to pry her from her cold dead hands. So I walked out of the house until she had calmed down. The second time was last night. The visit was already running late because she didn't bring a dinner (She has agreed to feed them dinner (the visits are always in the evening)) so the kids were eating close to bedtime. She asked to stay a little later and I said she could stay until they are done with dinner. My three year started getting upset that she was leaving so I told her that she would tuck her in and this appeased her. When we were upstairs and I was putting the other children to bed my oldest daughter started fighting with me over screens. I had to take the screen away from her because of her lashing out in anger with me but my ex-wife started joining in. She started belittling me and telling me I'm a bad parent and I'm not handling the situation correctly and that I'm wrong about everything I do with them. I asked her to leave and I told my oldest daughter that she needed some time to herself to collect her thoughts and to cool off a bit and that we would talk again in 15 minutes. She didn't calm down and my ex-wife was up there just fanning the flames. I asked her to leave a few more times and she refused and told me to call the cops.

I called the cops and showed them the court paperwork. When they came into the house they called out her name and she refused to respond every time they called her name. She made the police come all the way upstairs where she was clutching my youngest and oldest daughter. They politely told her that it was time to leave and she started telling them that my house was a pig stye and that I am a piece of shit and I don't deserve the children and the police just calmly told her that it was for the courts to decide and that it's time for her to leave.

After she left I had to spend an hour talking to each of the children individually. I had to practice breathing exercises with my oldest daughter because she was having a panic attack.

I'm not asking for legal advice, my questions is what should I have done and what can I do in the future if I am still required to supervise her with my children? She doesn't listen to anything I say and she refuses to back down or cool off at all.

Is there a better way to phrase ""I think you should go cool off for a few minutes and then we can talk about this again?""

How should I have handled my oldest daughter in that situation? What do you do when you have someone else breathing down your neck? I thought de-escalating the situation was the best thing to do, was that correct?

I guess I am just second-guessing all of my parenting instincts right now.

When I try new things, or try to feed him what I made for my SO and I, my son won’t even give it a chance. As I’m walking towards him with the plate of new foods, he will already have a look on his face like ‘nope’. In the mornings I can usually get him to eat a Eggo waffle with syrup (not healthy, obvi), for lunch sometimes he’ll eat a hot dog with no bun or sauce, and for dinner it’s a complete toss up if he will eat at all. I make him multiple meals and it just doesn’t work. Veggies, pasta, nothing! So frustrating. He likes to snack on gold fish through out the day with some juice. His all time  favorite snack that he will eat no matter what is chocolate donuts but I really want to break him of this terrible eating pattern he has. I’m not sure what to do!! Anyone gone through this before? Any tips? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

April 2019 - we tried the Oh Crap! Potty training method. We crashed and burned. It ended with him holding his pee for about 12 hours, then peeing in the bathtub and subsequently being terrified of the potty. It took us 6 months to just get him to sit on the potty again. 

Throughout 2019 and 2020 we have had some (maybe 2?) unsuccessful and fleeting attempts at potty training.

My husband and I are currently expecting, and I will be returning to work full-time after 12 weeks. We have not finalized anything, but we plan on having my MIL watch LO 2-3 days and my mom watch LO the other 2-3 days/week. They have both offered to do so for free; however, my husband and I are planning on offering them \~$30/day and any gas money (we want them to come to our house). 

As of right now, the plan is for them to watch LO for \~2 years. At that point, depending on how everything is going, we will consider putting LO in daycare for socialization. We are starting to think of some rules/boundaries for our moms to follow, but we are having a hard time. I am sure it will be easier once we actually have our baby, but all we have so far are these (specifically for 3-6 months):

* All feeding is on-demand (excluding visiting me on my lunch break)
* All sleeping is on-demand

Absolutely No:

* Food or beverages other than breastmilk
* Discipline of any kind
* Screen time

All of that seems pretty obvious, but we can't think of anything else. And as far as rules/boundaries for anything 6+ months, we are still stuck.

,Parenting,"I hope this isn't against the rules, I'm not really asking for advice, more sharing advice, but I have to share success story this with some fellow parents.

When our son was born (He is 22 months now), we got and received the normal number of various stuffies and blankets and such.  We watched to see which ones he liked best and to identify which one became the ""special"" one, so we could make sure it didn't get lost, donated, etc.  He eventually settled on this little elephant with a blanket body thing from Carters as his special one, and we named him Snuggly (well, nickname, his full name is Sir Snugglous de Snuggington, Fifth Snug Snearl of Snuggington forest, Snug Knight Defender of the Realm, and Member in Good Standing of the Royal Order of Snuggles) 

Unbeknownst to me at the time, once we were pretty sure that he was The One, my wife went on Carters website to by a back up.  Then she saw they were discontinued and on clearance so bought TEN back ups.

When they arrived I ribbed her a bit for OVER worrying about this, I've heard the stories of kids losing them and parents frantic search to find, I had one as a kid and had a few close calls, but didn't think it was that big a deal.

Boy was I wrong.

There have been a few times where he got dirty or something and it was convienient to have a back up to swap out, but nothing that big a deal.  Until today.

The Pooka is sick today, and his last set of molars is coming in, so he is not having a good day at all.  All he wants is mommy snuggles, PJ Masks, and Snuggly.  Well, after he ate a bit this morning, he was cuddling with snuggly and promptly threw up right on his head.  He was SO upset, not just at throwing up, which is new for him so he didn't understand what was going on, but because he did it to snuggly.  Obviously we had to take snuggly and he needs to get washed, and that just added to the trauma, but luckily, mom to the rescue, I took snuggly to the other room for a ""quick bath"" and he came back all nice and clean. (We have been rotating them through so they all have about the same amount of wear and smell to them)  Then, a short while later, I am changing his dirty diaper and he tries to help, with snuggly in his hand, and yup, you know what happened.  Trauma, tears, but another quick bath and snuggly was back! Then, just now, snuggly went head first into the trash, where I had just emptied the jar of excess sour dough starter.  A few minutes later though, snuggly was good as new! 

All in all, its been a very rough day for snuggly!

Any one of those incidents would have resulted in snuggly being unavailable for a couple hours to go through the wash and dry.  If we hadn't had back ups, or even just one back up, a rough day would have become a catastrophic day!

But it didn't and its all thanks to my genius wife!

(And a word of advice, if its at all possible, make sure you get back ups for your kids favorite stuffy and stash them away too!)

Edit: I absolutely love everyone’s stories and names of their kids favorite stuffy/lovey/bubby/etc. This was a long, rough day (he is doing much better now, fever broke a few hours ago and he is finally sleeping) and these stories were something I didn’t even know I needed to hear tonight!

(We have been rotating them through so they all have about the same amount of wear and smell to them)  Then, a short while later, I am changing his dirty diaper and he tries to help, with snuggly in his hand, and yup, you know what happened.  Trauma, tears, but another quick bath and snuggly was back! Then, just now, snuggly went head first into the trash, where I had just emptied the jar of excess sour dough starter.  A few minutes later though, snuggly was good as new! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, its been a very rough day for snuggly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any one of those incidents would have resulted in snuggly being unavailable for a couple hours to go through the wash and dry.  If we hadn&amp;#39;t had back ups, or even just one back up, a rough day would have become a catastrophic day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;#39;t and its all thanks to my genius wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And a word of advice, if its at all possible, make sure you get back ups for your kids favorite stuffy and stash them away too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I absolutely love everyone’s stories and names of their kids favorite stuffy/lovey/bubby/etc. This was a long, rough day (he is doing much better now, fever broke a few hours ago and he is finally sleeping) and these stories were something I didn’t even know I needed to hear tonight! Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;

And if I talk to him, he’ll groan between responses. It is literally constant until I park the car and then he totally stops.

&lt;p&gt;When he was an itty bitty baby and was especially tired, he would sort of hum himself to sleep. Mostly in the car, sometimes while breastfeeding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, literally every car ride, he is doing the constant UHHHHHHHHHHHHHH groan. It’s almost exactly the Tina Belcher groan. On. Every. Exhale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is not in distress. He’s not even tired when he’s doing it now. His emotion is purely neutral. I’ve tried louder and quieter music. Snacks and no snacks. Books and no books. Water and no water. Socks and no socks. Blankie and no blankie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I talk to him, he’ll groan between responses. It is literally constant until I park the car and then he totally stops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I completely alone here? Does anyone else’s kid do this? Any ideas how to make it stop? It’s driving me batty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a smart and silly little boy. No sensory issues, and by all accounts, perfectly healthy. Just quirky?&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Advice needed! 

My ex and I broke up when my LO had just turned 2. It all sucked very much. I was extremely ill, in hospital, then 6 months later it turns out that my LO was unwell too and had to have surgery. He then had to have nurses come to our house 3x a week to give medications etc.

In the year after ex and I broke up, he immediately moved hundreds of miles away (I understand that he wanted to be near his family again that’s cool), he didn’t have a job for the first 5 months but was sitting on a (very) comfortable amount of money; so he had the time and resources to come and visit his son but only came up 4 times in a year. He was unable to have LO stay with him until just after LO turned 3 because of the medical situation etc. Oh and I had to beg him to come up to be with his son for his operation.

He’s now wanting to come and get LO and have him for extended periods of time (I think the idea of 2 weeks was thrown around). I do not have an issue with him going to stay with his Dad, I definitely want my son and his Dad to have a good relationship. My only issue is that he seems to have forgotten that LO is a person, with feelings and emotions etc. I have practically not spent a single day away from my boy. He has had the very occasional sleepover at my sisters (though once he even got so upset I had to go fetch him - and that is my sister who he sees every week at least once). 

I tried to explain to my ex that he needs to build up his contact. Come to visit, stay nearby, have him 1 night at first, the next time 2 nights etc, see him on a regular and consistent basis before he takes him away from everything and everyone he is comfortable with. I even said that if I wasn’t unwell I would bring LO to him and stay nearby him to help with adjusting (I’m still too ill to travel just now though). It has been 18 months since the split and he’s visited about 5 times. But I can’t seem to get it across to him that he needs to think of our son when he’s arranging seeing him. It would break his heart to be torn away from me so suddenly for so long. And I would worry that it would really impact his mental well-being.

My ex thinks I’m saying this because I don’t want him to see LO which is absolute not the case. If he had kept up a consistent and regular visiting schedule since we broke up we wouldn’t be in this predicament. 
He even let LO down at Xmas and decided 3 days before he was due to visit he had changed his mind.

How do you know when a 3 year old is ready to be away from home for longer than he ever has been? How long is too long for a 3 YO? How can I help his Dad try and see things for what is best for LO? I’m getting so upset thinking that he’s going to ignore LO’s feelings and just do what he himself wants.

So when I became pregnant last year it was up there on my list of baby names. When my fiancé and I would discuss potential names we always came back to Elliott so a couple months before his due date we decided that would be his name. 

Well, two days before he was born I suddenly had the urge to name him Oliver. I told my fiancé and he ended up talking me out of it and we went with our original plan of Elliott. Weeks after holding him in my arms he still felt like an Oliver to me. I told myself his name will grow on me. Now he’s almost 5 months old and still feels like an Oliver to me...

,Parenting,"My 2 youngest kids (3m and 6f) are constantly at each other all the time. My 3 year old boy in particular is very naughty and hyper and the typical 3 year old. 

A little personal background: I have 2 anxiety disorders and grew up in a very tense household due to a brother with ODD trying to severely hurt me from when I was about 12 till 22. I didn't have much back up from parents. All I know is tension. I don't want the same for my own family. 

I am full-time SAHM and do probably 90% of the work with the kids and household due to DH's shift work.  

All day I hear yelling and screaming and fighting. I eventually tip over and just do the thing I hate most back, yell and scream to try and control it. My kids listen way more to their father who pretty much is the same as me at tipping point. For whatever reason he comes across as more authoritative than I do. 

I don't want to be a push over parent, and I know there are going to be bad days (I have a 13 year old too so it isn't my first rodeo, I get it), but there has to be a better way.

,Parenting,"TL;DR:  Biodad demands his son every weekend and refuses to practice social  distancing.  Me, my wife and our baby are home to the Stepkid during the  week.  How do we solve the dilemma of appeasing Biodad and protecting  ourselves?  Am I wrong here?

I  (42m) and my wife (36f) live in a major city on the west coast.   Married for a couple years now.  In normal times our home housed my  wife's kid, aka my stepkid \[SK\] (7m), during the week and our biokid  (1m) full time (obviously).   I work from home and take care of BK all  day and take care of SK before/after school.  Biodad takes SK on the  weekends.  All was well.

Since  lockdown SK has been staying with my wife's mom as she has had the time  to do his online schooling AND we wanted to let her have time with him  while avoiding CV exposure (although her husband, my wife's dad, is  still working and exposed to around 100 strangers per day -- we thought  he was going to take time off).  FF 7 wks.  This week kid arrangements  were supposed to return back to the normal schedule.

Biodad  picked up SK from my wife's mom on Friday.  Over the weekend he took SK  to a family birthday party.  CV distancing was not being practiced and  we found this out mid-party.  With no other options, SK was dropped out  our door Sunday eve.  Crossing our fingers is all we could do.

This  week went well with SK back in the house.  He's a handful, but I  managed to take care of the baby, school SK and provide him with  activities all week, keep the house clean and even get a few projects  completed.  My wife had a hard week.  She's in the medical field,  working daily with a 3-4 elderly patients in each of their homes while  she is in full protective gear.  Other than dealing with this  kid-logistics problem, our evenings are good and we are happy.

Today,  Biodad decreed that he has the right to see his son and also that  because of his living situation and CV-disbelief/CV-fatigue he won't be  following any distancing practices.  He intends to pick his son up every  Friday, spend the weekend with around eight people (all or almost-all  of which won't be distancing themselves) and returning him to us Sunday  evening.

I have a big problem with  this.  As a kid I had asthma and I'm worried about what CV might do to  me.  I also don't like the idea of our baby getting it, but more  importantly, I worry that if my wife gets it that she won't be able to  work and we will be at the mercy of the unemployment office.

I  put my foot down.  I said that if Biodad makes the choice to expose SK  to all of these people, then he needs to take care of him during the  week as well.  We could have distance visits with SK. (I love him to  death, BTW, happy he's been back)  Alternatively, Biodad could forego  his weekend visits for distance visits and we could continue to be his  home while my wife's mom takes him weekends so we stay sane.  (My vote  is protecting the older ppl and having him here 24/7, but my wife is  desperate for weekend down time to recover from the intensity of her  job. I feel her.)

Biodad won't  change course.  My wife won't demand that he take care of SK during the  week, even stands up for Biodad's situation.  She is so exhausted that  she just wants the easiest solution: SK rotating throughout houses.  I'm  hurt at her indecision and am stubbornly fixed in my decision which is  what I think is best for the family inside THIS house -- which hopefully  includes SK.

Biodad is a good dad  normally.  SK is a good kid and as a child of a successful divorce, I  understand the importance of spending time with both parents in a civil  situation.  The custody agreement is one that my wife and Biodad made  mutually without lawyers: 50% shared custody.  Nobody wants that to stop  -- under normal circumstances.  (I'm a little bitter that Biodad  doesn't actually provide 50% of anything... more like 30%, but for the  greater good and sake of harmony I keep my mouth shut most of the time)

I see few options and I need help determining which one is actually the ""best"" and if there is an option I'm overlooking.

1. We  say fuck it and just rotate SK throughout homes.  I think it's a matter  of time before we pass CV through this system and if/when one of our  parents (or one of us) gets hit we regret this decision.
2. We  tell Biodad that we won't keep his kid from him, but if he chooses to  expose SK to all of these people then he will need to care for SK  nonstop throughout the week.  (He almost never asks his family to help  and cites his contractor job as a reason he can't take any time off)   Biodad has already flatly refused this option.  If Biodad were to drop  SK off at our house after the weekend then we could no longer allow  Biodad to pick up SK from our house.
3. I  take the baby and stay at another location.  I hate this idea.  My wife  seems to lean this way, though.  I think she thinks its the easiest  choice... but nobody has yet to figure out who would watch SK all week  and administer his online schooling.  It's some kind of ""magic"" solution  that makes no sense to me.

I  hope someone has some advice.  I feel kind of obstructive right now,  but I just want to protect myself, my family and civilization in  general.  Am I being petty for wanting Biodad to deal with the  consequences of his actions and putting SK in the middle like a game  piece?  I'm hurt because I feel that my wife would rather put us at  risk, or be away from me and baby, just to avoid putting her foot down  with her ex.  I'm angry at Biodad for buying into the conservative  viewpoint.  I'm frustrated because now, all of a sudden, my wife can't  stand the idea of having to distance-visit SK even though she only  visited him a few times during the seven weeks he was at her parent's  house.",t2_6ezozrcx,False,,0,False,"BioDad scoffs at distancing, demands weekend visitations with son.

,Parenting,"Sorry if this is rambling. I’ve tried to be concise in my sleep deprived psychoses.

My children are 7 and 8 and are 15 months apart. I love spending hoards of time with them given I have balance and am able to have time to myself and time with friends. I’m also an introvert and love time at home reading, playing piano, and sewing. We have a lot of fun outside of quarantine and are pretty laid back people. 

My husband works 24-hour shifts (firefighter). He also took on two part-time jobs, one of which is nonessential and is on hold in quarantine, so he is gone for days at a time. I know that I don’t function well under those circumstances, but I’m working from home during quarantine with no access to parks, libraries, or play dates. This doesn’t afford me much variety. We can finally go on walks and bike rides with our dog now that it’s warming up. 

I discovered a few years ago that my kids respond well when I put myself “in a time out from questions”. I just can’t handle the constancy of being asked to help with this or that and never getting time to myself when it’s day after day without a break. When they go to bed I’m exhausted. Lately I can’t sleep at night, which compounds the problem. Sleep deprivation causes me to get psychotic, and a lack of a schedule or routine really messes  with my ability to stay on track. I also have my period, so I know I’m slightly more emotional and sensitive right now, and maybe it’s even menopause. 

How do you handle taking breaks from kids when you can’t really take breaks from them? Normally I love and encourage all the cuddling, and I’m always aware they won’t want to cuddle in a few years so cherish it now. I just want to tell everyone to get the #*&lt;@ off my lap, leave me alone, and give me space. Is it terrible if I start taking 30 minutes (an hour?) at a time to myself as long as I’m available should they really and truly NEED me? Maybe several breaks each day would help me. We don’t have the option of family close by helping even aside from the pandemic. I thinking of plugging into headphones with relaxing music and reading I the sun or something that will refill my very fractured bucket. 

My poor kid is crying because I’m so sick of them responding “whatever” to each other and to me when we are talking. I think that’s a hot button word, and I just lectured my son for using it.

,Parenting,"2 kids. The oldest is 2.5, the youngest is 9 months. 

My wife and are losing our minds to cabin fever like every one else. 
We temporarily moved out of our house which had a full on backyard to a smaller apartment to for a new job. As soon as the new role started we were hit with shelter in place. Shortly after that, daycare stopped and we were up the creek without a paddle. My wife and I are both only children and our parents live far away so the idea of locking down as a family with parents (after quarantine of course) was not an option. 


After watching my folks enjoy yet another hot SoCal day in a wide open backyard on our hundreth video call, the thought of ""no really, fuck this shit"" has entered my brain and by ""this shit"" I mean sitting cooped the fuck up in our apartment where the only exercise the kid is getting is running up and down the halls. 

So, the thought of taking the family out of our apartment and over to my folk's house where they would be able to run around AND we would have family support (we're still both under the gun to be high performers at work) makes sense. To a point. 

Logistically, we would be facing a lot of issues. 

* Flying is not really an option (we think) because, well, its nearly a fight to the death to get our kids to wear a facemask for more than 5 minutes before we have to fight them again to be sure they don't touch any parts of their faces with their grubby hands. Masks are becoming a requirement for the entire duration of flights. There is also the issue of exposure even though (without testing) we suspect we have been exposed long long ago. 

* the drive from coast to coast is about 41 hours give or take - BUT there is the kid factor. The longest drive I've ever done with any of our kids has been 4, maybe 5 hours max. In a normal world the way around this is to stop every few hours for a playground break so the kids can burn off energy. Playgrounds across the country would either be shut down or a breeding ground for stuff. Lately we've skirted this issue by going to wide open industrial parking lots, I don't feel that would be a safe option in parts of the country we're unfamiliar with. 

* the drive would happen in an SUV so we're at the mercy of hotels n' motels and whatever level of cleaning/sanitization is happening (or not, probably not). Renting an RV turns out to be dumb expensive so it's kind of not an option. 

* once we arrive - because our statuses have not been confirmed we would likely hunker down in an airbnb for two weeks before we would even think of entering my childhood home. my parents are healthy now but they both have managed preexisting conditions. 

That said...is it even worth it? I estimate two adults without kids running at full steam could power through a coast to coast drive in a few days. With kids the drive would be a 5 days easily. If lockdown goes for as long as I imagine it will then the cost of a 1 week drive each way, plus a waiting period of 2 weeks would potentially be worth the 4 weeks of grandparent time.

,Parenting,"Dad here, this just might turn into a long post

Some back story my son is turning 5 years old in June. We’ve had issues with his feeding since day one. My primary questions revolves around eating and behavior habits.

Brief medical history as follows:

· 1st heart surgery 5 days old

· Surgery to get a tube put in his stomach for feeding due to seriously reflux issues ( 3 months old)

· 2nd heart surgery 9 months old

· 3rd hear surgery almost 3 years old

· 4th heart surgery the next day, undo the process they did a day earlier

My son is doing well in-terms of his heart condition and other issues etc. Eating is still an ongoing battle for us, for the 1st 4 years of his life he was just tube fed basically we would plug a tube so he gets his feeds overnight and then during the day as per the doctors, now  were trying to teach him to eat with his mouth more since the last 1.5 years he takes too long to eat in an average if we try to go thru all his meals it takes mom approximately 7 hours a day.

First he wasn’t even open to the idea of drinking water from his mouth it took a lot of effort to get him to do that, he still have bad reflux but now he’s off that medication.

He is still eating puree and mom is trying really hard to teach him to eat solids. He just puts food in his mouth and sits, we never knew eating is also a learned behavior (the things we take for granted) we’ve tried everything now it’s getting to the point he only eats when mom yells at him in almost every meal. As a dad im a bit of a softy when it comes to him so I don’t really yell at him but he gives me hard time as well. We had an appointment with the cardiologist this week and they are saying to put him back on the stomach feeds thru the tube since he hasn’t grown since last year. We’ve spoken with other parents who are in the same shoes and were given the same recommendations told us they just had to push thru in order for their child to eat thru their mouth, the hospital gives up too easily.

I’m also trying to address some of this behavior issues or trying to he’s gotten a bit of temper now he just gets mad and goes sit in another corner and doesn’t want to talk. He listens more to mom when it comes to when she asks him for something and that is because she yells at him when feeding him that’s the only way he eats. I really don’t want to go down that path with him just not sure what to do at this point.

,Parenting,"My child is almost 7. I dont feel like the answers google gave me resonated. So I am asking it here.

My child was very sweet, listened, spoke early, VERY INTELLIGENT (not a brag. She is doing fourth grade math and fifth grade reading level) and has ADHD. 

Now it is a battle to get them to follow through.

I am always patient because I know and respect the fact their brain is what it is. I have adhd too.

I will tell her once. Twice. Three times. Fourth time I will tell her I am getting aggrivated. Fifth time I give the parent stare. Sixth time its a throw down. Do what I asked or there will be consequences.

And sometimes there are consequences and they act so betrayed and surprised.

Situation A: It is over trivial stuff. Putting on socks. Writing their name on their school work. Putting down a book/tablet to eat. Brushing their hair. Picking up their coat.

They will start. And then tell a story. Or go to another room for no reason. Or pick up a toy and play with it. Or just sit there. 

What we ask is not beyond their ability.

Things that are no big deal. My emotions are known. We talk about it all the time and ask how we can help them get things done. 
A quieter room? Music playing? Are you hangry? Sleepy?

They are usually fine. They just dont follow through. 

Situation B: ""stop doing x."" They lick their lips noisily after each bite. Stop. They will say okay and do it again. Not malicious. Just oblivious. 

If we say to stop playing a key during music lesson they will do it. We say stop we need to teach you something. And they will do it again! Like no impulse control. The urge to do the thing after being told no. 


They have remorse when they mess up. They really do. They cry because they want to get things right so badly. But my words dont process unless I am showing visible anger. Stern face. Raised voice. Etc.

The 9 year old doesn't care if she fails. She is very smart, but refuses to work unless someone is right next to her, forcing her. When she's constantly being forced she gets perfect scores. (But then she has an exceedingly bad attitude.) It's so frustrating! I struggle daily not to lose my temper.... This issue has been happening for maybe three-ish months now. 

We've tried removing privileges, not allowing her to play with her siblings and friends until it's done correctly, no screens, extra credit assignments... none of it seems to be making any impact.

Lately, I've been trying to challenge her to see if she is bored. She just throws tantrums and refuses to do the work. Next I tried taking her back to see if we are missing any skills. Same result, but add ""I ALREADY KNOW THIS"" to the mix. Time outs have no effect. She's perfectly happy to literally sit and use her imagination indefinitely. 

We've been homeschoolers for almost all of their schooling, and I've never encountered this issue before. Usually we can work through it.

,Parenting,"My son is a young adolescent and has minor ESE needs. He can get hyper-emotional at times. He performs adequately in school and has come a long way in the past few years. As all of us are, he is learning the new rigor of Distance Learning. 

His school is more hands-on than other schools in our District. Teachers are doing full lessons live and interacting with the kids as much as possible, but due to time constraints they are relying on a program to record students reading that uses Machine Learning algorithms to score the student's diction and pronunciation for classwork. This allows teachers to aggregate recordings and see if specific outliers exist that need more one-on-one.

My son was reading a story in this program that was rather sad. It was a story of a father going away in the military and leaving his young daughter. During his reading, the teacher must've noticed he was very emotional and texted us to let us know he was crying. We both went in and he explained how the story he read made him very sad and emotional. Mom had to go back to working so I stayed and listened to him finish out the story, intermittently sobbing in between sentences.

Finally, he finishes his reading and hits the Submit button. About 15 seconds later, he starts wailing crying. He looks at me, red-eyed and full of tears, and say ""It made me cry and gave me a ZERO."".. how can you not be heartbroken hearing that. Apparently, he was sobbing through the story so much that the machine learning algorithm had no idea how to classify him and was forced to give him a zero.

Thankfully, this wasn't actually scored. The teacher knows he comprehended the story better than most based on his tears while reading it, so nothing will be held against him, but it really highlighted the dangers of leaving grading rubrics up to machine learning.

I’m not really sure at this age how much my child can comprehend, since speech is delayed (she does say words but started late and needed some help from Early Steps to get her talking, it’s been a great help). Not knowing how much she can understand makes discipline difficult, as I’m not really sure what to do when she has meltdowns. She will hit me and if I try to say “Ouchie no hitting!” She hits me again. At that point I hold her hands and say “Arrow you cannot hit me.” Typically she will throw herself on the floor after this, hit herself in the head and face, headbutt anything near her. 

What I do varies on the severity of the meltdown and the mood my child is in. If I think she can be talked down I’ll talk her down. If she is hurting herself I will either put her in her bed to thrash on something soft and leave the room until she is a bit calmer or if I feel like she can be talked down I’ll hold her til she calms down, like I said it depends on my kid.

He’s 6 and an only child. His father and I are not together and his father remarried. My son is with me Tuesday night through Saturday morning. Otherwise he is at his father’s Sat-Tues.

I’ve been WFH and he’s been remote learning 1st grade since mid-March. We’re struggling to say the least and I don’t know what to do. He has no siblings to play with and really misses his friends. Like any other 6 year old boy he has a ton of energy.

Every day we’re home together is tiring from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. He hates playing alone and is constantly asking me what to do next. I give him 20 different things he could be doing. He’ll pick something for 5 min and then be right back at my side asking what to do next.

He’s used to always having someone to play with at his dad’s because his dad has him weekends or days he isn’t working. I work on the phone where I have to speak to one customer after another and can’t have noise/distractions in the background. I’ve shortened my work hours on days he’s with me to give him the attention he needs/deserves. Still does not seem to be enough for him.

I feel like I’m failing as a parent. All day I spend frustrated that I can’t get any work done because my son can’t find something to do. All day he spends bummed out that I can’t play with him or pay full attention to him. I feel like I’ve tried everything to keep him busy and nothing works longer than 5 min.

His father and I have agreed to limited screen time so plopping him in front of a device all day isn’t an option. What are other parents doing to keep their kids busy and HAPPY? Especially parents WFH without a spouse or SO to help.

This mama is sick of crying every night because I’m struggling to juggle mom, employee, teacher, and entertainer.

,Parenting,"I’m a mom of 3 and my youngest is just awful, as the title says I just feel like throwing in the towel. 

Let me preface by saying none of my 3 kids are perfect or even close to it, we all have our flaws. 

My older two are overall respectful, they don’t always like their chores but they do them without attitude. One is an honor roll student (school comes easy, he’s lucky) and the other is an average student who tries very hard and really earns the grades. Neither one of them have been in much trouble, they have bad days though. The worst would be the oldest was suspended in middle school for one day for him and his friends creating a group using school iPads and posting memes in said group that were not appropriate humor for school. The other child got in trouble 4 years ago for not doing school work because it was “too hard”. We discussed it and she busts her butt now, school is still hard but she tries hard. 

My youngest has my head spinning, wondering if some kids are just born “bad”. I just don’t understand what is going on. He’s in 3rd grade. In an effort to make this shorter I will just talk about things that have happened in the past year...

Caught taunting/hurting animals: throwing football or hitting baseball towards horses/goats, calling dogs or cats to him and then throwing water in their face, sitting next to dog while watching TV and I catch him bending the back leg in a way it shouldn’t be bent. He likes to pull legs off various bugs and watch them try to walk with fewer legs. He’s not allowed to be alone with any animals now. 

Three times found evidence of playing with fire, denied every time and tried to convince me that someone snuck into his room and lit matches under his bed and someone was framing him by burning his Uno cards under his bathroom sink. 

Stealing other peoples holiday candy (many many times) after eating all of his and then lying about it. Found the evidence in his room and he just flat out denies it and says he doesn’t know how it got under his bed. 

He gave a boy at school a black eye because he was holding the basketball and it was against the rules so he jumped on kid’s back and repeatedly hit the ball and kid’s face until kid let go of ball. 

He had an old iPhone color (no service) to play games on, I check all the kids electronics it’s a rule that I always have access or it’s cut off immediately. Checking his phone I see he made a video of him pulling his pants down “for the girls”. When confronted he acts like he doesn’t understand why I’m mad because “I didn’t post it! I can’t post on YouTube!” I honestly don’t know where he got that idea from, I use parental controls and my oldest son is gay so I know he didn’t see or hear him making videos for any girls. His sister still plays imagination with LOL Dolls. I’m genuinely at a loss on this one. Also had videos of him jumping on the phone and throwing the phone trying to break it. 

I’ve found my jewelry in his room. He doesn’t know how it got there. 

He’s come home from school with a nice (for a kid) watch. Someone gave it to him. I told him to give it back. A couple months later I found it in his school desk. 

He’s a very manipulative child. We were at a game his sister was cheering at and I over heard him telling someone that works at the school “I can’t play baseball because I have to stay home and take care of grandma so brother and sister can do cheer and track and field.” Not true, he can’t play baseball because of the videos on the phone, that was the punishment as well as losing the phone. 

In the beginning of the school year we took him away for a long weekend for his birthday, just him. He missed two days of school and his teacher made him a make-up packet. He told me that he finished it at school. Report cards came and he’s almost failing! Turns out he’s throwing his make-up and homework away. I didn’t have a way of knowing because his school doesn’t do agendas and the only homework kids have is class work they don’t finish in school. 

I’ve heard him say things to other kids like “I don’t care, I’ll just tell everyone you did it and they’ll believe me.” Sadly, it’s true! I feel like our immediate family are the only ones who sees the real him, everyone thinks he’s an angel and you can’t tell them otherwise. 

Yesterday the kids were working on their school packets and he comes to me and says “I finished this much so I’m not doing anymore today.” I don’t roll that way and I let him know that he was way out of line, he doesn’t get to tell me what he is and isn’t doing. So I told him that he just earned the reward of sitting at the table and finishing ALL  of his work. He later said he was done and I said I would check it tomorrow and we could fix/go over anything that was wrong or he didn’t know. I felt bad, it was a lot of work but he needed to learn a lesson, so I figured I would give him a break without him knowing I was giving him a break by checking the work tomorrow. Well, today came and I find out he didn’t do ANY further work! We were doing pizza and a family movie tonight so he did his school packet instead. 

These are just some key points, this is a daily struggle. This behavior has been going on since he was two (I’m not joking, he started stealing when he was 2. He would get up in the middle of the night and steal everyone’s phone and play until they were dead.) He’s entitled, rude, disrespectful, manipulative, he’s mean to animals and other kids. He truly thinks that he should have the same rights as any adult. If I allow him to do something once he automatically assumes that he can do or have whatever it was forever now. I have to specifically tell him things like “Just because I said you can have a popsicle now doesn’t mean you can have one whenever you feel like it, you still have to ask.” Or “I know grandma said you can watch her TV but that doesn’t mean you can come over anytime and just change the channel on her, you have to ask.” If I don’t say that he always says “Well, it was fine before.” 

I’ve tried rewarding him for being honest and making good choices. I’ve tried spanking him. I’ve made him throw away all his toys, TWICE. Manual labor. Sitting down and trying to talk to him. I’ve tried taking him and doing one on one time. Nothing works for him. 

Do you think some kids are just born bad? He reminds me of my sister when we were growing up, who has Narcissistic and Histrionic Personality Disorder. I just don’t know if there’s much I can do to help him. I’m honestly fearful of when he becomes a teen, I think everyone will be getting locks on our bedrooms doors to sleep.

,Parenting,"So this is my second Mother’s Day. First year as a single mom. Last year, I was with my daughter’s dad and even though our relationship was really bad, he went out of his way to make it a special day for me.
This year, the thought kind of depresses me. I know it’s not about gifts or being spoiled or anything, but the appreciation is nice... I know that’s selfish.

This year, the thought kind of depresses me. I know it’s not about gifts or being spoiled or anything, but the appreciation is nice... I know that’s selfish.  My daughter doesn’t have anyone to have her make gifts with so I won’t have any homemade gifts that she “made” when she was so little and idk, it just makes me sad. &lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Some background: Literally no one my child even knows can play piano. No one in my family plays an instrument, except her father who plays guitar. He can play by ear exceptionally well, but has never had lessons or reads like sheet music or whatever it's called. 
I bought my daughter a toy keyboard at a tag sale when she was 3. We took it home and put batteries in it, and she immediately figured out how to play ""hot crossed buns"". I thought that was impressive. No one taught her anything, so just kept hitting the keys until she found the ones she wanted, then strung them together. Then twinkle twinkle little star, then the sesame street theme song. I thought this was pretty amazing, and I swore I'd get her lessons, but no one around me started lessons that young. They told me to wait.
I'm a shit mom sometimes, and I never tried again, life got in the way. When she was 5, she learned to play the intro to the Tool song Schism (please don't judge, I'm not letting her listen to Tool, she walked into my office when I was listening one day and then played the song on the Amazon Echo until she could play it on her keyboard). And a few other random ""real"" songs, like a Taylor Swift song. So right before the shutdown (she's 6 now) we were going to enroll her but not surprisingly, I never got around to it. This morning she taught herself Chopsticks in its entirely, the theme song to the show Bluey, and the beginning of Moonlight Sonata. Nearly perfectly, too. We tried to watch some YouTube videos that teach piano, but she refused to watch and threw a total fit. We can't enroll her in lessons right now, for obvious reasons, and I don't know when that will even become an option again. I don't know ANYTHING about music, so I'm of no use to her. So I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas how I can encourage her, or how she can learn in a more formal/proper/normal way. And also is this normal? Is she average or is this something even worth pressing her to do?

We welcomed a baby girl 7 weeks ago. Everything is good - working from home these days gives my husband and I the chance to devote more time to her than paid leave would provide. She is healthy, sleeps well, and I think we're doing a pretty decent job for first time parents.

The problem is my anxiety. Holy cow, you guys. Yeah, I've done therapy, and it was fine until I had a baby. Now everything is, ""What if something happens to her? What if something happens to me or the husband? What if there's a freak accident/I drop her/someone hurts her/someone breaks in/we get in a car crash..."" and on and on.

The thought of anything happening to her or my husband can make me tear up. We're in our 20s and I should not be occupied with thoughts of death and mayhem, but they are persistent thoughts and they keep returning every night.

,Parenting,"Hello! So I guess I’ll get straight to the point. I have a stepdaughter (14). I’ve been with her dad for 8 years known her for a little more than 7. There are three kids in between us a daughter of my own (9) and a son together (6). Throughout our relationship she has falsely accused me of abuse and neglect. Now when she was young while it hurt my feelings I know it was to playcate her mother and they couldn’t prove I was abusing if I wasn’t . However it never stopped. In fact during a court case between mom and Dad last year, she called dfs and said I locked her in a hotel closet. The court case has ended and we now have much more time with stepdaughter.

I do make bends in the rules for her I wouldn’t with the other kids, but I still maintain a certain set of expectations. However, yesterday I caught her telling her grandma I wasn’t feeding her and was trying to kick her out and abusing her. I literally hadn’t even seen her at all that day. I let her sleep until noon because she says she’s up until 4 all the time at home. Her grandma had called to see if she needed to buy food for us and ask what’s going on and that’s how I found out. My step daughter then proceeded to throw a huge fit, say she was running away called her dad and told him I hit her. Who then texted me, didnt ask what was going on just went off on me how I abuse his daughter. At that point I’d had enough. I told him, my step daughter, and her grandma (who we share custody with as mom is deemed unfit) that from now on she can’t be left alone with me. That her dad needs to be here and if he isn’t I need to go somewhere. At 14 she’s knows the difference and is honestly just using it to get her way.

But I feel like my hands are tied and either I do as she says or she’s telling dad or grandma I abuse her. I let her keep her phone at bed and at dinner.

I understand I let this go on too long before I stood up and now everyone is furious with me. And now I’m at a loss now I don’t even know if my decision was the right one. I know she’s frustrated. She’s 14 and she is spending a ton more time here and I don’t just let her run the show. I have tried to make bends and let her get away with extra. But I feel like my hands are tied and either I do as she says or she’s telling dad or grandma I abuse her. I let her keep her phone at bed and at dinner. There’s no real set bedtime for her, there’s no set wake up time or homework time. I let her make her own schedule all I ask is she do what she needs to at some point during her day. We do have times when our relationship is great but any time I try to tell her anything or correct her at all she flips. I’m just so confused, frustrated, and could use absolutely any insight that I can get.&lt;/p&gt;

I see all of my friends with babies who are even younger and they are eating puréed foods and mashed foods just fine.

My son has been breastfed exclusively since birth and he is beyond obsessed with it. We started introducing puréed veggies and fruits a couple months ago and he seemed to enjoy it.

I try to give him cereal in the mornings and he just spits it out at me. I try giving him purée fruits and veggies and he either gags or spits it out. I’ve even tried finely mashed fruits and he legitimately gags to the point that he almost throws up. He will even continue to gag after it’s out of his mouth, his eyes getting really watery too. I try to give him the spoon and he has no idea what to do with it. I’ve also tried putting the food in front of him on his high chair to grab himself and it’s like he has no idea that he’s supposed to eat it. He just smashes it in his hand and whines to be picked up.

He loves to chew on frozen fruit in mesh teethers and suck on fruits like watermelon and strawberries but I can’t get him to actually eat things!

Then we started doing the rice cereal (I know, a little backwards) and he enjoys that. Now, in the last few weeks, he doesn’t seem to show interest in eating much at all. I try to give him cereal in the mornings and he just spits it out at me. I try giving him purée fruits and veggies and he either gags or spits it out. I’ve even tried finely mashed fruits and he legitimately gags to the point that he almost throws up. He will even continue to gag after it’s out of his mouth, his eyes getting really watery too. I try to give him the spoon and he has no idea what to do with it. I’ve also tried putting the food in front of him on his high chair to grab himself and it’s like he has no idea that he’s supposed to eat it. He just smashes it in his hand and whines to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves to chew on frozen fruit in mesh teethers and suck on fruits like watermelon and strawberries but I can’t get him to actually eat things! No matter how much we force it or consistently try he continues to gag or spit it out. All he ever wants to do is breastfeed! Accept for the rare occasions before his bedtime where he’ll eat some rice cereal. I’m trying to wean him from breastfeeding but I can’t if he won’t eat anything else. Please help!! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

My baby girl is 6months old and has been a cat napper since birth. She sleeps in her crib for both night sleep and naps, however she would only ever sleep from 20 to 40minutes for naps, and on a night she would wake up every 20/30 minutes about 5/6 times before she would fall asleep for a slightly longer period of time..

So I must admit in desperation I put her to sleep on her tummy for her a nap and watched her. She slept for an hour and half without waking!

So my question is, now that my baby can roll both on to her front and back, can I lay her to sleep on her tummy? Or should I continue to put her on her back??

&lt;p&gt;My baby girl is 6months old and has been a cat napper since birth. She sleeps in her crib for both night sleep and naps, however she would only ever sleep from 20 to 40minutes for naps, and on a night she would wake up every 20/30 minutes about 5/6 times before she would fall asleep for a slightly longer period of time..&lt;/p&gt;

One time was the day before my 15th. My Mum would make such rude remarks infront of my brother and Dad about my clothing she would wash, I had a boyfriend and she thought there was sperm on my clothes (there wasn’t, gross, probs make up idk) but humiliate me shouting it all around the house whilst my brother and Dad would look at me like filth. She would say I would self harm for attention. She would be in and out of hospital for suicide attempts and my Dad would always say I don’t give a shit (I was literally under 15 and had no idea how to deal with this) I got locked in the house with my phone taken away and the landlines put out. It was always trouble for them if I needed new clothes. I wasn’t aloud the same food as my Dad, he always had the nice food and I had to have the much cheaper versions, I wasn’t aloud to eat salmon or anything new because it would be for my Dad (they had the money too just they spent it on alcohol, cigs or my dads food) I went to a couple hostels and I spent most of my teenage years barricading myself in my room. When I was really young, I wasn’t aloud to play on the street with all the other kids so I would watch from the drive way, we never went the park or anywhere. I remember my Dad kicking me for dancing in the living room.. My mum would always terrorise me when drunk and my Dad would just sit there and let it happen even though I would be screaming, crying and begging for him to get her to stop, he would just carry on drinking his beer.

I’m 21 now, mother to a nearly 6 month old and I’m TERRIFIED. I have really bad mental health, funnily enough after getting kicked out at 18 for sticking up for myself, I made contact and we made up. My Dad is so fucking racist I CANNOT STAND IT. We are a white family and we didn’t have it hard.. but he still thinks white people are so hard done too? He will never mention anything violent that’s happened to a community of other colour but will always rant and rave how white people are always hurt and “no one cares” and that he’s not racist but all black people are really stupid like what? How can you even justify that comment with something so fucking ridiculous.. he told me that if women are raped then they should keep the baby cause it’s not there fault. He told me I shouldn’t put lipstick on in public because men will think I want sex from then. I miscarried at 17, I fell to the floor crying after and he just stood there watching me pick myself back up. I fucking hate this white supremacist, sexist, vile pig. sorry, ANYWAY it’s my Mum I want a relationship with, I know she hurt me but I feel it’s not her fault cause of her mental health but with her comes my Dad cause she’s still with him even though he was watching and wanking off to porn in our living room in the early evening whilst we were upstairs (I was pregnant at the time and would be too scared to go get a drink in case he was watching it) which my Mum classes as cheating but she still takes him back.

I know it’s all in my hands now how I look after myself etc but I feel they’ve made my life so much harder bc I’ve developed bad habits that I’ve had for a lifetime. I was heavily involved with drink from 13 which later turned to drugs where I nearly died from taking Xanax and alcohol. The alcohol started bc I wanted to be out the house and escape on the weekends cause that’s when they would drink... I remember they refused me any of my clothes when I went to a hostel n to just rewash the ones on my back.

EDIT: abit more background. I am the youngest of 6. My Mums first died from SIDS when she was 16. She had another kid 2 years after who she left. Her third child she stopped bothering with when she was 12. Her fourth child, she packed up me and my brother and left to move to the top of Scotland when we were in mid England, she left his behind with his foster Carer and never provided a number or address to contact her and she never bothered getting one for him, I found him on Facebook years later, he has been in a psych ward for 6 years with paranoid schizophrenia. My 2 sisters who she basically abandoned have never had a relationship with her until very recently they’ve been messaging over Facebook. My brother who I grew up with is the golden boy, never hurt, never got harassed or mistreated and he loves my Mum but hates my Dad (my other siblings don’t share the same dad) 

My Mum split with my dad once and me, my Mum, auntie and cousin went to a hotel and my auntie and mum were having sex with 2 men on their beds, the men could see us looking at what we were doing on the bedroom balcony (the room had a second floor where you could look over at the first floor where they were) and said we were watching and my mum said let them. We were 7 and 8. I’ve always been told my Mum used to sleep with a lot of men, she even encouraged me to cheat on my boyfriends cause I was young and should have fun. 

My Dads parents never gave him any attention at all, he never used to tell me he loves me and would always be told by my Mum to hug me, he was told by my mum to apologise for him strangling me and he said he wouldn’t do it if I didn’t upset or hurt my mum then said sorry. My mum suddenly has no memory of him hurting me even though she watched it happen..

My Mum would tell me she loves me and is proud of me etc but then quickly turn to ignoring me for hours/days if I did something wrong so I would feel like I had to win it back. 

The racism really bothers me, I don’t want it rubbing off on my impressionable son who doesn’t understand. I grew up my whole life to the raves and rantings of “the bloody Muslims” “oh they’ve got black people presenting” honestly it knocks me so fucking sick, my blood absolutely BOILS and I’ve tried so hard to get it in their head that their opinion is so dated and disgusting but they won’t have none of it.

Over the last couple of weeks I’ve noticed some very distinct good and bad days with him. I can literally fell from the second we wake up. 

A good day begins with him smiling at me as soon as he opens his eyes, is generally a happy day with minimal fussing other than the usual hunger/tired/bored/unwell and I can get some stuff done (albeit not much) without him kicking up a fuss.

A bad day, he won’t smile when he wakes up. He’ll spend the majority of the day screaming, crying, fussy and angry. I have to pick him up constantly and even that doesn’t calm him sometimes.

,Parenting," Hello all! I need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

How/when did you breastfeeding mamas choose to stop pumping?

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: My little man turned 8 months old Monday (May the fourth haha) and he has been breastfed since birth. When I went back to work in November he was 2.5 months old and EBF. Eventually, though, we had to start supplementing with formula because I was not able to pump more than what he was eating at the sitters (I did have a freezer stash that dwindled fast). At that time it was only 1 formula bottle while I was at work and he got boobie ""from the tap"" all other feedings. In the last month or two he started getting frustrated while breastfeeding, even after eating off both sides, and crying in hunger afterwards as well. More recently he has started getting so worked up and crying when I try that he won't even look at my boob. He will only nurse in the morning right after waking up, otherwise he refuses to latch. My pumping sessions at work have been on the same schedule since I came back (pumping an average of 8oz per day in November), but I'm now only getting about 0.5oz total for the day. We have since started solids, so I know that contributes to a drop in production. I have also gotten new parts for my pump, so I know the suction is good as well. I also bought a manual pump to keep at home and when he started sleeping through the night I would pump before bed (and last night I got not even half an ounce).

&amp;#x200B;

So, my dilemma is the fact that I have to pull someone from another office to cover my desk twice a day so I can pump 25+ minutes each session.

,Parenting,"My wife and I had our first kid recently. He's about 2.5 months old now. It feels like he has all the problems possible without having serious medical problems.

He still has trouble breastfeeding. We've tried everything the LCs told us, everything the doctors have told us, and everything we've read online. Nothing has really worked. Now the position he accepts is lying down. He still struggles, squirms, pulls back, etc all the time. He never really pops off himself, we always have to manually pop him off after 30 minutes. He eats every 2 hours during the day without exception. Everyone told us he would start feeding for less time and less frequently but it hasn't happened. Every two hours my wife has to go struggle with him to eat.

He has pretty bad acid reflux. He is still gaining weight which is great, but he vomits constantly. I don't mean spit up. I mean vomit, thick yellow curdled milk stinky vomit. All day long. We hold him upright 30 minutes after eating. He pukes several times. Afterwards, he will continue to throw up until it's time to eat again, which feels like no time at all because it takes him 30 minutes to eat, 30 minutes to stay upright, and that only leaves 1 hour remaining until he's screaming for more food again. We've removed all the top 8 allergens from our diet. That got rid of the blood in his poop, but it's done nothing for his reflux. We got a rocker that is supposed to hold him upright, but he hasn't taken to it after several weeks and he still just throws up in it all the time. I started tracking the vomit the last few days and his number of vomits were 16, 19, 21, and 18. We are at our wits end with the reflux, but the doctor just keeps saying it's fine as long as he gains weight.  Our medicine to help with reflux pain got recalled and the new medicine doesn't work as well so now he's in pain after vomiting all the time.

And gas. He has gas pains all the time. Bicycle kicking does next to nothing. The thing where you straighten their legs and them push up doesn't do much either. Sometimes he is inconsolable for 20ish minutes, usually followed by a poop. 

When is it suppose to get easier? Everyone keeps saying it's supposed to get easier. When?? It feels like it's only gotten worse.

There should be some software (or settings on PC) I could use to give our kids feedback on their own voice volume when wearing headphones... Sometimes we let them play games in the early evening so we can get some quiet time. But when the kids have their headphones on, their voice volume goes to almost yelling level.

Even if you try to warn/condition them, after about 5 minutes they completely forget and occasionally shout out something excitedly. Today my wife wanted to take a nap but kept getting woken up. What I really want is software that causes a beep or very loud feedback back into the headphones when the mic volume goes up past a certain decibel level. Just so there’s some classical conditioning feedback loop and they can learn to speak at low (or at least normal volumes), not like some excited Youtuber.

In certain games you can set the game and chat volumes differently, but you’re still not getting your own voice level feedback. And the problem exists even for watching a video.

If she's not saying those words, she's  throwing herself on the floor, crying, kicking her feet, having a true meltdown tantrum. She has noticeably regressed in maturity.

She has severe ADHD, mild atypical autism, and pretty bad learning disabilities bc she's dyslexic. She's doing pretty good with the whole stay home thing bc she hates school.

We agreed that if something happens to one of us, the other will look after their kids, and then i created one of those [apparently someone thought this was advertising so removed the name] app accounts to upload instructions, birth certificates, doctor information etc. to automatically send if I’ve passed away.

I was wondering if there’s anything else I should do? What have you guys organised?
I’m also looking into life insurance too (as I’m main income provider)

EDIT: Summary of Tips so far

1. Life Insurance - Have it 🙌🏼
2. Speak to people before handing over guardianship.
3. Pick people that understand your parenting style and are in good health. If possible, have backups just in case too.
4. Leave important documents and information (birth certificates, passports, video messages) in a fireproof safe or use something like aforementioned app

I have a 5 year old son.

He knows that Grandpa is sick, and has been in the hospital a few times recently. He is also very aware of COVID, and knows that we are staying home to stop the spread of the disease because it can make people very sick.

Besides the fact that I am trying to process my own grief that my parents are going to have to go through this alone, as will my siblings (none of us can get to them or each other), I have to figure out what to tell my kid.

Should I tell him in that Grandpa has become sicker, and is going to die?

Should I tell him nothing in advance, and tell him after it happens that Grandpa's body was too sick and he died?

My big concern is that I do not want to traumatize him, and I don't want him thinking that Grandpa died of COVID, or that it might kill him too.

,Parenting,"The weather has turned yet again typical, resulting in us having to find things to do inside the house.

We’ve always had a lovely home growing up but when we moved into this house we had a lot of plans and ideas that didn’t happen soon enough or still haven’t happened. With time things change, pipes burst and flood through the kitchen ceiling and the list goes on.

With all this time we now have on our hands we’ve come together as a family and helped each other with the home improvements that the house has needed.

Due to Ro’s condition, we have to make sure the house is extra clean also because we do have dogs so this year we invested in a steam cleaner and oh my has it been a game-changer when it comes to cleaning.

The house has never been dirty we just have a lot of stuff so we’ve spent the week going through all the kitchen cupboards sorting, throwing, steaming and organizing each one.

The crazy thing about it is that the kitchen which has always been the heart of the house is now a happy place for all of us.  
Every night we have dinner together and most day breakfast and lunch too.

The boys have worked really hard and done an amazing job outside cleaning and drive and garden, Ro, of course, loves every second he can get outside to watch them.

With the house looking better it’s improving the way the family are feeling being inside and it’s feeling a little more like a home instead of just the house we live in.

Not being able to leave the house for walks with Ro is a little frustrating because I truly believe it helped me mentally, I didn’t have a build-up of emotions when we would walk it was a stress relief for me as well as exercise.

I’m not going to pretend that now I’m not walking I’ve started to work out at home because that would be a lie but what I have started to do is change my relationship with food. No more snack or big portions, Not eating just because it’s lunchtime when I’m not even hungry and I’ve started to feel so much better with myself and slowly I’m starting to see a difference in my body.

I would love to post a picture but I want to see some real changes before I do any of that plus, I still have some of the mum tum to get rid of.

My natural skin and hair journey still continues and I’m also starting to see a change in that too and it’s making me feel so much better every day. If I do put on some makeup it’s only my eyes and brows that I’ll do to still allow me skin to breathe.

With the lockdown, I’ve made the changes I should have made a long time ago because now there are no excuses and I refuse to be lazy and not try.

Ro goes to bed at the same time every day with no problems and has started to wake up less. He is eating nearly all of his food without most of it going on the floor, he now crawls normally but still thinks he can get up and walks so there’s a bump here and there but he’s all good.

He’s my first child and everyone thinks their child is amazing but, I really do think I got lucky because as much as he can drive me up the wall sometimes he’s a very good baby. I think because he’s not a problem when he does something it seems bigger than it is.

Every day is a blessing, even more so when you’re surrounded by people you love.

&lt;p&gt;The house has never been dirty we just have a lot of stuff so we’ve spent the week going through all the kitchen cupboards sorting, throwing, steaming and organizing each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing about it is that the kitchen which has always been the heart of the house is now a happy place for all of us.&lt;br/&gt;
Every night we have dinner together and most day breakfast and lunch too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys have worked really hard and done an amazing job outside cleaning and drive and garden, Ro, of course, loves every second he can get outside to watch them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the house looking better it’s improving the way the family are feeling being inside and it’s feeling a little more like a home instead of just the house we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being able to leave the house for walks with Ro is a little frustrating because I truly believe it helped me mentally, I didn’t have a build-up of emotions when we would walk it was a stress relief for me as well as exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to pretend that now I’m not walking I’ve started to work out at home because that would be a lie but what I have started to do is change my relationship with food. No more snack or big portions, Not eating just because it’s lunchtime when I’m not even hungry and I’ve started to feel so much better with myself and slowly I’m starting to see a difference in my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to post a picture but I want to see some real changes before I do any of that plus, I still have some of the mum tum to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My natural skin and hair journey still continues and I’m also starting to see a change in that too and it’s making me feel so much better every day. If I do put on some makeup it’s only my eyes and brows that I’ll do to still allow me skin to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the lockdown, I’ve made the changes I should have made a long time ago because now there are no excuses and I refuse to be lazy and not try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ro goes to bed at the same time every day with no problems and has started to wake up less. He is eating nearly all of his food without most of it going on the floor, he now crawls normally but still thinks he can get up and walks so there’s a bump here and there but he’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s my first child and everyone thinks their child is amazing but, I really do think I got lucky because as much as he can drive me up the wall sometimes he’s a very good baby. I think because he’s not a problem when he does something it seems bigger than it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day is a blessing, even more so when you’re surrounded by people you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guys, keep you’re chin up and keep smiling because life is what you make it and nothing good came from a frown.&lt;/p&gt;

He is a good brother to his younger sister who is 1 year old. He plays and shares with other kids his age. Daycare says hes a good lil boi. --

He's been very ""over - dramatic"" for quite some time. I don't know if this is normal or what. My son is the first baby I ever held/taken care of.  Please educate me. 

For example: When he finishes eating I help him wipe his hands and face with a baby wipe or whatever is available at that time. I barely touched him and then he screams bloody murder and saying owie!! you hurt me mommy!! and cries for 5 minutes straight. He has real tears flowing.. He acts the same way towards me or my spouse.

I'm scared someone might call the cops on me because his cry is so loud you can hear it outside. I don't want my neighbours to think I'm abusing him... because I am not! 

When it's time for bedtime, his sister is great at this. She crawls into her bed, drinks her bottle, sucks on her thumb and then sleeps. I don't really need to reassure her. She knows the routine. 

On the other hand, my son... I tell him it's bed time. He has a full melt down in his bed for 1 hour straight. He would kick and scream. Sometimes he will wake up his baby sister when she's passed out. Sometimes he will give up on crying and stay in his bed in silence. (we have baby lullabies playing in the background) or he will get out of bed and kick the door.

We have a consistent routine: dinner, bath time, bottles, sleep. --

If we try to do that right now, she'll be fine for a bit, maybe play around with something, and then start wailing for us to come back. She won't sleep unless we hold her.

,Parenting,"My 6yo has minimal patience, and I'm not sure how to help him. We try to model patience, and I remind him every day that being patient shows kindness and respect, but nothing is improving. Any ideas?

For instance, in our Zoom class this morning, all 15 kids were sharing something they made. He was excited to show his creation, and like the other kids he raised his hand waiting to be called on. When he wasn't the first called he said, ""Oh come on!"" and slumped back, looking dejected. Then he would gather himself again and raise his hand, getting increasingly agitated when not called on. The other kids just stayed in the shot with their hands raised, but I had to encourage him to gather himself after each disappointment, ""It's ok. Your turn will come. Look what Julia brought!"" etc. After the 10th kid he just ran away and I had to calmly bring him back.

At other times he won't stop fiddling. He has a really hard time receiving direction and paying attention for more than a brief period. Instead he'll search for something nearby and start playing. I keep his ""work area"" clear before class, free from distraction, and I've found that giving him one small thing to hold is better than nothing. He has had difficulty sitting still since he was 3.

This kid is going to have a really hard time in 1st grade if he can't figure this out before the Fall. Without patience he doesn't persevere, and without persevering he isn't learning as he should. He is behind and only drifting further, and I have no idea how to help him.

,Parenting,"DD (19) avoids exercising as if running a lap once in a while will give her COVID 19. I think a large part of this is because of her early negative experience with sports. Her middle school was basically mini-Sparta and would force the kids to run a 5K every week (?!) and graded the kids based on ridiculous activities, like how fast they could climb a 15 ft long metal pole (?!!) or juggle three balls (?!!!!!). As a result, DD got a C in middle school PE even though she was a Straight A student otherwise. 

DH also forced her to play soccer for five years, which DD hated the entire time and only quit after I threatened to divorce DH if he didn’t let her quit. DH has been calling her a sore quitter ever since, which I think adds to her anti-athletic attitude. Not to say she was athletic in the first place (she’s so incredibly slow and uncoordinated), but it certainly doesn’t encourage it!

She doesn’t even want to get out of the house to walk around the block once in a while, and sure as hell won’t accompany me on my runs.

,Parenting,"I guess I’m not really asking for advice but I’m about to make a decision and I feel very badly about it. I have a husband and two kids, 11 and 13. We have been social isolating very strictly, more so than most I think. Mostly because I got very sick over a year ago, a respiratory illness lead to me having a stroke. So I’m cautious to say the least. Both my kids have friends with birthdays coming up. I feel so much empathy for isolated kids figuring out how to celebrate right now.

One family is my best friend who is also strictly social isolating mostly because she’s naturally very introverted. Her son and my son are friends and he has a birthday soon. I love her but we parent very differently. We both live on acreages in areas with no other kids in walking distance. So I’m used to being very proactive, driving my kids around town to see friends, organizing events, volunteering at school, getting to know other parents. She doesn’t do these things much so her kids are very reliant on people being dropped off at their house or other parents inviting them to things. Which is fine, they’re very independent kids. They invited my son over for a sleepover as a birthday celebration.

The other family is a woman I know through school (she’s also super active involved parent) and her daughter is friends with my daughter. They announced for the birthday they will be driving from friends’ house to friends’ house to drop off cookies (professionally made so no one has touched) and we can decide how much socializing we feel comfortable with. I love this idea because they can stay on our patio for a visit and we can hangout without getting to close. Also this family has been allowing lots of random kids into their home because they are in an area with lots of blue collar, 2 working parent homes and kids alone in apartments all day. So not a lot of isolation going on. I really appreciate their consideration. And I admire their selflessly opening up their home to these kids.

My daughter is often sad because she will hear about her friends getting together at this home and she feels left out. I explain to her that she is very lucky to have room to roam and lots of exploring the country and these kids who are stuck alone in an apartment need to weigh their mental health against possible risks. Good answer but still hard for a kid.

I told my son I’m not going to approve the sleepover because I don’t know if that is frowned upon right now. Most people I’ve mentioned it to have reacted negatively, like “I don’t think you’re supposed to do that yet” He was understanding, I’m so blessed with a mature young man.

At the same time if I approve the sleepover because risk is low suddenly my daughter sees her brother having sleepover, her friends getting together and she’s isolated on the farm with only her baby ducks and chicks for company. If I open up sleepovers for one kid I have to for both.

My problem is telling my friend. She’s going to be offended, she and her son are going to feel that I am keeping him from having a fun birthday. I just fear that’s how they’ll react. I just wish she’d get active and plan something else. Like a social distance bike ride through a park, where kids can come and hangout.

We will be flying American Airlines. Our first flight is a little over an hour. Less than an hour layover, and then another hour flight to our destination. Same schedule coming back. 

We will be taking our 6 year old (I am not worried about him) and our 7 month old. Our 7 month old is pretty chill. He hardly ever cries. He likes to people watch. However, I did not buy him a seat of his own so he will have to sit on one of our laps (I have read that we could take his car seat on the flight if there is an available seat next to one of ours, but I put our seats together and my oldest son’s seat with my mom). So I plan on checking his car seat at the gate. 
He likes to be rocked to sleep. We have a rocker here at the house and that is how I get him to sleep for his naps and to put him down at night. I feel his car seat will be extremely useful on this trip specifically because of that. 
Now, these flights are not that long. The longest being an hour and 15 mins. I am just not sure how long he will sit in one of our laps before he gets irritated. What could we do to keep him entertained?

,Parenting,"Firstly Apologies for the long post, i'm hoping this is the right place for this.

To be a little bit more specific I'm a guy and my step child  is a boy (he's nearly 9) and he still has his real Dad in his life.

His father is not a great role model for him, without basically insulting him constantly in this post he's basically an alcoholic, although anyone on here who is from the UK will understand the drinking culture we have and that there's no such thing as drinking to much. He treats his son like a ""Mate"" rather than a son he's also quite manipulative so we're not sure what he might be saying to him when other people are not around (we've had experience with this in the past with him)

So he goes to see his Dad roughly 2-3 days by sleeping at his Aunties (Dads sister). My partner is still reasonably good friends with his Auntie and I get along with her too which is why we know exactly what goes on when he's with his father. There two or so days consist of his Dad sitting in a separate room with a separate TV drinking himself into oblivion whilst watching Football (soccer) whilst my step son plays on his xbox in another room for most of the two days, (they might kick the ball about  in the garden for 10 minutes occasionally).

His Dads sisters and his one brother (he's one of four) ignore &amp; excuse his drinking behaviour all the way because he's family, and ignore everything that comes with an alcohol addiction, the selfish behaviour etc lack of consideration for others the people skills, manners, etc.To compound this problem his Dad never tries to teach any of these skills to his son and his Dads siblings don't attempt to teach or correct his behaviour because they believe it's his Dads responsibility.

What I think is happening is because he's going to see his Dad over the weekend and he's letting him run Riot (and obviously he his Dad) he thinks that's how his life should be. Obviously when he's back home with me and his mother we're really the only two in his life trying to teach him any sort of life skills and he just doesn't want to listen, also we're not sure what his father is saying to him which is a cause for concern because he's a bitter and manipulative person in general (or can be)

I gather he's young and a boy so this might just be me worrying to much, but I do fear that he'll have no real decent life skills i.e. manners, consideration for others, diligence etc.

Obviously when he&amp;#39;s back home with me and his mother we&amp;#39;re really the only two in his life trying to teach him any sort of life skills and he just doesn&amp;#39;t want to listen, also we&amp;#39;re not sure what his father is saying to him which is a cause for concern because he&amp;#39;s a bitter and manipulative person in general (or can be)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gather he&amp;#39;s young and a boy so this might just be me worrying to much, but I do fear that he&amp;#39;ll have no real decent life skills i.e. manners, consideration for others, diligence etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any advice I get.&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Just a little background info to set the stage.

I left my wife of 5 years about a year and a half ago for many reasons. Basically, she's a manipulative, poisonous person that I believe has a borderline personality disorder, depression etc. It was toxic, I got out for me and my son.

I have moved on and am in a really great relationship. We recently got a place together and have my 6 year old son probably 60-75% of the time depending on  the month and what drama his mom has going on.

My son is really adjusting well in his new space and seems generally content. The one issue I am dealing with is the massive difference between households and how to navigate that with him. At his moms house its like the friggin wild west. She lets the kids ( she has another 13 year old boy, who to be frank is a little asshole due to lack of parenting) basically do what they want. Her other kid hangs out on media all day, stays up as late as he wants etc. My son, from what he tells me, is pretty much the same. Stays up past midnight watching his iPad, doesn't make him brush his teeth regularly, just lack of general household rules etc. It's the bare minimum ""parenting"" at all times.

At my house it's the opposite. I have a daily schedule for him that he checks off with his basic stuff on there. Wake up, get dressed, brush teeth etc. He earns media time by doing learning activities and his daily stuff. He has outside play time and playtime set aside for us throughout the day. I interact with him a lot.  He generally does well but I **constantly** have to battle with him to make it through his daily routine all because of one thing... "" *Mom doesn't make me do this, I hate the rules at this house*"".  Every day, all day its push back about everything. Most days he's a little grouch as I guide him through his routine. It's exhausting.

I currently navigate this by explaining to him that the things we do are healthy normal things he should be doing throughout the day. Just because he doesn't do them at his moms doesn't mean he shouldn't do them. I'm trying to teach him to be accountable and do the right things. I sure as hell don't want him growing up to be like his step brother.

,Parenting,"Hello lovely parents! Hope you're all staying somewhat sane during these crazy times. I have been on maternity leave since October, scheduled to return 3-30-20, but due to COVID worked sporadically for a month while trying to wrangle toddler &amp; new baby (now 7MO) and opted to take unpaid leave of absence for the next 2 months, as my family is being relocated, and I don't have childcare available anyways.

Possibly slightly pertinent information, as I never had intended to be a SAHM and now I've been thrust into the situation after being a working mother for the last 3+ years. My toddler will be 4 in August and is ridiculously smart, sweet and imaginative. However, he's recently started apologizing for every little thing that happens, if he thinks I may possibly be upset about it. 

Recently, he has had a few incidents of peeing in the tub instead of the toilet (which we're fine with during bath time, but this is just randomly throughout the day - leaving dried up urine in the tub), and peed on his floor twice this week. He's been fully potty trained for over a year (minus nighttime), but has peed on the floor in the past as an act of aggression, though it's been a very long time. I tried to be understanding of him possibly just having an accident the first time... but then he peed in the same spot again the same day. He said he wanted to help me clean it, and I really tried hard not to lose my cool. I explained to him that I was frustrated and asked why he peed on the floor a second time, to which he just responded ""I'm sorry, mommy""... today he knocked over a bowl of water we were using to grow some little dinosaurs in, my cup of coffee (outside - thankfully), and just does a lot of mildly inconvenient, toddler-y things like flinging crumbs all over the place when I ask him to take his plate to the kitchen. He is constantly apologizing though, regardless of my reaction. If I even look at him, and he thinks I may possibly be upset he apologizes. I feel like I'm being too hard on him, possibly, but I don't honestly know the best way to get through to him in regards to just being aware of his surroundings.

I think some of it may be because we are completely just flying by the seat of our pants lately. He goes to bed around 8:30-9:30, and wakes up sometime between 8:30-9:30 in the morning.

On top of that if I want a date night I have to plan it. Holidays are hit or miss but most of the time he doesn't get or plan anything.

&lt;p&gt;*** this is the ultimate Reddit cliche but I’m editing to add a huge thank you to all the commenters. You have no idea how helpful it is to just know I’m not alone. I’ve always prided myself on being able to handle whatever comes at me, but hearing from others how impossible this is, I reached out to my boss and said I want Monday’s and Friday’s off until this is over!&lt;/p&gt;

I really really do. And I talk myself down everytime my insecurities get the best of me and I end up thinking these things. 
My children (5 and 9 years old) split their time between their dad and I in a very unique way. Dad and I are best friends. Actual best friends. We talk daily. We hang out. We get along great, and I can’t imagine my life without him in it. 
He has a girlfriend, who I really do love. She’s sweet, caring, great with my children. She has never overstepped any boundaries, yet treats them as her own. Her and I have somewhat of a friendship as well. We have hung out to go shopping, texted here and there. She’s come over and hung out with the kids and I while their dad was at work. 
The problem is, I get so irrationally jealous at times of my children’s relationship with her. I don’t get me wrong, I love that they have someone else in their lives that is good to them and that they’re comfortable with. The fact is that there is going to be someone there, and I’m lucky that it’s her, and not someone who doesn’t treat my children well. 
There are so many times though, especially lately, that my insecurities get the best of me. I start to think everytime my kids say they wanna go to their dads, that it’s because they prefer being with her. She gave my kids some toys and I immediately thought, well now they’ll prefer her over me. She’s just trying to win them over to keep their dad around. I 100% know that this is wrong and untrue. But it doesn’t stop these thoughts from eating me alive at times. 
On Mother’s Day this year, I have to work. So the boys will be with their dad. He’s told me to come get them after work, take them any other day I choose, whatever I want to do to celebrate Mother’s Day.

Instead, I’m sitting here upset thinking, well this girl gets Mother’s Day with MY kids, and I don’t. She hasn’t mentioned it. I’m not even sure she knows that it is Mother’s Day.

We had planned to be moved to a different area by the time he needed to be enrolled but now because of the pandemic and my partner being on furlough we have missed the opportunity to move to a better district in time to get our son in school.

So the question is do we go ahead and enroll him in a terribly rated school (one we havent and may not be able to tour until school starts due to the pandemic) so he can be around other children and developed some socialisation skills or do we keep him home since prek is not mandatory? 


We are first time parents and he is our only child so all of this is new to us. We want to do right by him and I know he desperately wants to make friends but he has also already expressed concern for being away from home. I'm worried if it is a stressful environment for him it may scar him for the next better school he will have.

Well today it was 90 degrees out so I was out in the front yard letting the Cheeseburger the Tortoise walk free to get some exercises.  After awhile I decided to water some plants.  Watering some plants let to watering a lot of plants which led to me going in the backyard to tend to something else.  About 15 minutes later my husband came out and asked ""Where is Cheeseburger"". I had completely forgot he was even outside.

,Parenting,"My awesome kids are 9, 11, and 13. I was single and childless until I married their dad two years ago, so I'm still pretty new to parenting. I honestly, have great kids. I love them, and they love me. They were really rough around the edges at first, being raised by a dad with really didn't care about things like table manners. Obviously, I didn't raise them. Which is probably the main reason we butt heads about a lot of things. They just don't understand why they should be careful with things. 

I was raised in a house where you were not allowed to do things to break things on purpose. Like rock in chairs, or treat them like they are play toys. Or squash, or rip things apart just for fun. My kids love to rock chairs around, lean in them, or do anything else that I was trained not to do when I was young, because it loosens and breaks the chairs. When their dad notices, he stops it, and gets after them; there used to be a lot more kitchen chairs, but they have broken the rest. 

Any time my kids are around a chair, they put their foot on it somewhere. I tell them over and over not to. Especially since they put one foot on the part that goes between the chair legs, grab the back of the chair, and rock it around. Which is one reason why all the chairs in the house are wobbly... I've mostly gotten them out of tipping it like that, at least when I'm around. But they still try and stand up on the supports between the legs. (I don't know the official term for those things.)

They have to stand on a kitchen chair to put some of the dishes away. Today, my 9 year old tried to stay up on it while leaning on the counter with one hand, tipping it over with the other, and shifting it to the side to move it. Which is not only unsafe for the chair, but unsafe for them.

When I ask the kids not to do things like body slam each other on the ottoman, they act confused. They don't understand why they shouldn't. I actually banned them from touching the ottoman for a few days last week because they wouldn't stop dragging the ottoman across the room for fun. I've only been telling them they can't do that for two years. (It scratches the wooden floor, and one of them always tries to flop on it before the other one gets it to its destination.) I give them reasons, and they look at me like I just started speaking in a foreign language. Sometimes (But not as often as before.) they immediately go back to it if I'm not around, like I haven't been telling them the same thing for the last two years. (That's another thing... I am so sick of, ""I didn't know that!!!"" and ""I didn't mean to!!!"" that I want to scream. I feel like they are old enough to understand and be more careful of certain things. When one of them does something they shouldn't, the other two screech to them loudly enough for me to hear, so they actually know, and get reminders. 

Maybe I just need better consequences? I'm so outnumbered by them at times, I can't constantly watch all three of them as they go about their business in different parts of the house, AND get things done around here. I feel like I would be a completely different parent to them at this age if I had raised them from the beginning. But I have to go back to simple basics like ""don't smash the furniture"" instead of just letting them do their thing. 

Thank you for reading this, I know this was sort of rambling. I haven't left the house much in the last few weeks, to be in contact with a lot of other parents, and I can't complain about my kids to my kids.

Will they ever grow out of this?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Behaviour'}]",r/Parenting,False,6,behaviour,0,False,t3_gdzqr7,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Behaviour,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588721052.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Parenting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My awesome kids are 9, 11, and 13. I was single and childless until I married their dad two years ago, so I&amp;#39;m still pretty new to parenting. I honestly, have great kids. I love them, and they love me. They were really rough around the edges at first, being raised by a dad with really didn&amp;#39;t care about things like table manners. Obviously, I didn&amp;#39;t raise them. Which is probably the main reason we butt heads about a lot of things. They just don&amp;#39;t understand why they should be careful with things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a house where you were not allowed to do things to break things on purpose. Like rock in chairs, or treat them like they are play toys. Or squash, or rip things apart just for fun. My kids love to rock chairs around, lean in them, or do anything else that I was trained not to do when I was young, because it loosens and breaks the chairs. When their dad notices, he stops it, and gets after them; there used to be a lot more kitchen chairs, but they have broken the rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time my kids are around a chair, they put their foot on it somewhere. I tell them over and over not to. Especially since they put one foot on the part that goes between the chair legs, grab the back of the chair, and rock it around. Which is one reason why all the chairs in the house are wobbly... I&amp;#39;ve mostly gotten them out of tipping it like that, at least when I&amp;#39;m around. But they still try and stand up on the supports between the legs. (I don&amp;#39;t know the official term for those things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have to stand on a kitchen chair to put some of the dishes away. Today, my 9 year old tried to stay up on it while leaning on the counter with one hand, tipping it over with the other, and shifting it to the side to move it. Which is not only unsafe for the chair, but unsafe for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask the kids not to do things like body slam each other on the ottoman, they act confused. They don&amp;#39;t understand why they shouldn&amp;#39;t. I actually banned them from touching the ottoman for a few days last week because they wouldn&amp;#39;t stop dragging the ottoman across the room for fun. I&amp;#39;ve only been telling them they can&amp;#39;t do that for two years. (It scratches the wooden floor, and one of them always tries to flop on it before the other one gets it to its destination.) I give them reasons, and they look at me like I just started speaking in a foreign language. Sometimes (But not as often as before.) they immediately go back to it if I&amp;#39;m not around, like I haven&amp;#39;t been telling them the same thing for the last two years. (That&amp;#39;s another thing... I am so sick of, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know that!!!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t mean to!!!&amp;quot; that I want to scream. I feel like they are old enough to understand and be more careful of certain things. When one of them does something they shouldn&amp;#39;t, the other two screech to them loudly enough for me to hear, so they actually know, and get reminders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just need better consequences? I&amp;#39;m so outnumbered by them at times, I can&amp;#39;t constantly watch all three of them as they go about their business in different parts of the house, AND get things done around here. I feel like I would be a completely different parent to them at this age if I had raised them from the beginning. But I have to go back to simple basics like &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t smash the furniture&amp;quot; instead of just letting them do their thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this, I know this was sort of rambling. I haven&amp;#39;t left the house much in the last few weeks, to be in contact with a lot of other parents, and I can&amp;#39;t complain about my kids to my kids. My husband just tells me I&amp;#39;m right, but he doesn&amp;#39;t know how to deal with it. (He also doesn&amp;#39;t care as much as I do about it, or notice it as much as I do.)&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve shared this between r/parenting and r/askparents, so I’m sorry if you’ve stumbled across this twice. 

He’s in the 98th percentile for height and weight, has excellent learning and development, and is a generally happy and fun little guy. But he’s hungry. So hungry, it’s a concern for us. We feed him well, he eats great food and there aren’t any vegetables, grains, meats etc he doesn’t like or not regularly eat. He has well thought out servings of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. But.. it’s not enough. We’ve tried increasing his protein intake further and it’s still not enough. It may or may not be early to be concerned about it, but we don’t want to have an overweight kid. My whole side of the family struggle with weight, whereas my wife’s are slim - if his genetics are more aligned to my family then this is a reasonable concern. This isn’t a new thing, it has been his whole life so far (milk through to solids) and we’ve waited to see if it calmed down, but here we are.

This may very well be exacerbated by being in lockdown and stuck at home, but it’s also not something unique to this time. He’s not bored, we’re doing activities constantly and playing around. Between every meal he’s constantly asking for more food - and rattles off every food word he knows while trying to get our attention (moves chairs in to the kitchen to try get in to cupboards, gets his plates or bowls out to show us he wants more food) and gets extremely angry when we don’t give in to his demands. He wakes up and says banana. He’s not hungry, or at least he shouldn’t be - believe me when I say he eats more than enough, and it’s wholesome food! No junk food, sugars, only water etc. 

Eating itself is a whole other issue, it’s like he’s worried about the food being taken away so he eats insanely (worryingly) fast to the point he might choke while eating, all the while putting more food in his mouth. This is probably part of the same issue, but honestly if this was the only issue and he wasn’t always hungry between meals then it would seem like this was an okay challenge to work through - but not both at the same time. 

He’s obsessed with food down to pulling recipe books off shelves (specifically cooking books, he doesn’t touch the other books) so he can bring them to us and open them up on a page to show us the food. He’s obsessed with food to the point where when we’re having a family dinner and he (always) finishes first the rest of our own meal becomes a fight for survival while we try to finish our dinner as he’s trying to eat ours. My wife has snacks hiding in the pantry so he doesn’t see her and want some.

,Parenting,"I had my first when I was a teenager, whos dad left me days after I gave birth. I got pregnant again a few years later, after a long term relationshipx, and the father left me when he found out I was pregnant. I then spent a few wonderful years as a family with my two kids and a new partner. We bought a house, we were engaged. He then told me he wanted to have another child, who was born 3 months ago, and baby daddy number 3 has now also left me. He said it was all too much and he’s just realised he doesn’t want kids. After spending years with me and my children from previous relationships, after sticking by me through my pregnancy, after telling me he wanted a baby. 

So now I have 3 kids, by 3 different fathers, who have all left me. I’m struggling a lot with the children. I never thought I’d be doing this alone. Especially since number 3 was planned. 

Now I watch from the sidelines as the fathers to my kids achieve amazing things, going to university getting great jobs and going on amazing holidays, going through girlfriend after girlfriend. And I’m here, raising the kids, without even an hour to myself at any time.

I got pregnant again a few years later, after a long term relationshipx, and the father left me when he found out I was pregnant. I then spent a few wonderful years as a family with my two kids and a new partner. We bought a house, we were engaged. He then told me he wanted to have another child, who was born 3 months ago, and baby daddy number 3 has now also left me. He said it was all too much and he’s just realised he doesn’t want kids. After spending years with me and my children from previous relationships, after sticking by me through my pregnancy, after telling me he wanted a baby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have 3 kids, by 3 different fathers, who have all left me. I’m struggling a lot with the children. I never thought I’d be doing this alone. Especially since number 3 was planned. &lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Hi all

I was wondering if anyone had any advice? I have an awesome 3 y/o and my husband and I generally go for a positive reinforcement method when it comes to parenting. We don't spank and feel like time outs should only be used a tool to remove our kid from a situation that is causing him to freak out. He's pretty well behaved and we're pretty happy with everything.

One thing I am struggling with is how to address misbehavior at bedtime. Typically my husband and I switch off laying with him until he falls asleep each night. We enjoy being close with him and he loves having us there. He knows when its bedtime he should lay in his bed and try to sleep. For the past 2 weeks when it's my turn to put our son to bed, he immediately gets up and starts to attempt playing/being silly/etc with me, even after I remind him that it's bed time. I started leaving the room (after a warning) for about 5 minutes and then try again. But he's been seeming afraid that I'll leave him each night at bed and seems worried about the idea.

I don't want him to feel that I don't want to be around him and that he only gets love when he behaves. But I have no idea how else to address it. He only really does this with me for the last 2 weeks, and goes to sleep without too much issue on my husband's nights. So I don't think he's needing a later bedtime. 

Basically, am I damaging my kid and is there a better way to work on this?

,Parenting,"TW: description of injury to a child

Yesterday was the scariest day of my wife's and my life. I was outside with my 8 year old stepson, MIL, and the dog. I was wrangling the dog when I heard my MIL yell, and when I turned around, I saw my stepson face down in the dirt at the bottom of the front porch, not moving. MIL said he fell off the porch. I ran over and he was still not moving. At this point, my wife heard the commotion and ran outside to where we were.

We rolled our son over and he had a blank look and a mouthful of dirt. He suddenly started seizing. He has had febrile seizures a handful of times before, but never randomly or due to an injury. We immediately knew this was serious. My wife tried to position him so he wouldn't hurt himself while I called 911. I did my best to comfort my wife and MIL while talking to the 911 operator. I don't know how long our son was seizing, couldn't have been more than a minute or two, but it felt like forever. My MIL was hysterical and my wife was sobbing while she did her best to tend to our son, but she must have felt so helpless.

He finally stopped convulsing, and very gradually started coming to. We could hear the ambulance in the distance at this point (thankfully, we live about 5 minutes from the nearest ER.) Our little guy never changed color much, he was breathing normally once he started coming out of the seizure. Once he started coming out, he instinctively started twirling his hair with one of his fingers, and we all kind of nervously laughed with relief because that's one of his most common absent-minded habits and we knew our little guy was still in there. He tried to talk and move but we kept him still and calm.

The paramedics were great, so kind and helpful to our son and us. They put a neck brace on him, loaded him into the ambulance, and my wife rode with them to the hospital as my MIL and I followed behind.

Of course, due to the coronavirus, they would only let one family member into the hospital with him, so my wife was with him while his grandparents, his dad, and I waited on a bench outside, waiting for word of his condition.

Ultimately, they did a CT scan, checked for concussion, and miraculously, they did not see any damage, bleeding, or any signs of a concussion. He was just very tired from the seizure, which he always has been after having a febrile seizure. The doctors believe that since he has a family history of seizure disorders, he may just have a lower threshold for what injury would cause a seizure, so even an injury that's not severe might cause a seizure for him. I was so relieved when I heard he was alright. He was eventually discharged and we all went home. Once home, he took a nap while we stayed close by (the docs said we didn't need to keep him awake or anything, but we wanted to be safe.)

When he woke up, he said he thought it all was a dream. He has no memory of falling, just of being in the ambulance and the hospital.

Even though we now know he's going to be alright, it has been a rollercoaster of emotions ever since the accident. Yesterday after he came home, my wife kept alternating between feeling totally numb and crying her eyes out. I love my stepson like he is my own blood, but I've only been in his life for the past 3 years and I know my emotions can't compare to his biological mother's. Last night, she stayed up most of the night to keep checking on him. She said she was scared if she went to sleep, she'd wake up to him dead. She is better today, but still having waves of emotions and saying she keeps picturing him seizing in her mind.

As for myself, I feel like the emotions didn't really hit me until today. I know logically my stepson is okay, but I feel like the emotional equivalent of being hit by a truck. I feel so physically and psychologically drained, very on edge and emotionally raw. I feel like I have very little patience or tolerance for any emotional distress right now.

I'm trying to focus on easing my wife's emotional trauma from this incident. I feel like I can hang in there until she feels better, and then I can let go and process my own emotions. Maybe not the healthiest way to go about it, but I want to be strong for her because she seems to be struggling more than I am right now.

,Parenting,"Hey guys just a quick vent and in need of some word of wisdom if you guys got some. 

First time parent here, daughter is 1 years old and a month. 

Now I know, I’m sucking it up. I’m manning up to the situation. I’m just having a moment of weakness. 

I know that my time will now be taken by this cute bundle of joy. But now I am just so frustrated cause I can’t find a free time for myself. 

Monday to Friday, I work then come home, help with the baby, then eat dinner and shower. Weekdays watch baby all day and nap when baby is napping. But now it feels like a constant cycle and it’s making me crazy. 

Even when I spoke to my wife that I need this time off, it feels like so much pressure to finish I can’t even enjoy the task. 

My hobby is making videos and podcast. I need to be in the room to do this, but I can’t concentrate with all the moving and crying. Then by the time the baby sleep at night I can’t make any noise to do my podcast. 

Because I can’t do my hobby I’m getting frustrated and fighting with my wife and being in a bad mood. 

I don’t want to go through this again. I’m really considering 1 and done. Any advice from parents here that got more than 1 child or learned how to have free time?

I go jogging at a park daily and left my daughter a note yesterday and she had been up until 10am from the previous night. The second I got to the park, my mother called and asked if she could borrow my pulse-ox for a family member (our town is sold out). I called my child and no answer. Texted, no answer. My mom said she was on her way to my house and my daughter did not answer her phone a total of 5 times. I needed her to let mom in and started worrying also.

I had to leave the park the second I got there and when I came home, I was shocked by what I found. I knocked on my child's door and no answer so I flung it open and her room was an absolute mess. There was a used sanitary product on the floor, her phone was next to it, and next to that was a SPILLED glass of full water. Inches from the phone.

When I woke her, she said it's ""not her fault"" the phone ringer was off. I took it from her.

I left the house and the note remained that I was at the park.

When I returned, I sat her down and explained that the up all night on the phone is unhealthy and I am worried for her. Here are the following responses:

""You never cared about my mental health before so why do you care now."". (not true)

""I have insomnia what do you expect me to do?"". (I offered tea and sleep aids and she started screaming and hitting herself)

""You're taking away my personal possessions and ruining my life"".

""I have lost all my friends now because of you"".

""Why do I have to apologize to you when you're the one taking my life away?"" (I told her I never asked for an apology)

""It's my life and my phone and you need to give it back now."".

I explained to her she is affecting other people with her all-nighters and she told me it's quarantine so ""who cares"". At one point in the conversation, she threatened to run away and then started hitting herself. She accused me of starving her and trapping her in her room all day when she came out while I was at the park and even took a shower while I was gone.

New day and she is still locked in her room by her own choice. I don't know what to do at this point. I feel our relationship is damaged to say the least.

,Parenting,"Warning, long post. I don't know that anyone can help. I just need to get it out. I tried talking to my mom today, and she just started criticizing my husband and I for our parenting style. 

We have a 4 year old son, and he's SO energetic. He was in a preschool before COVID came along, and had some behavioral issues, but nothing major (mostly just normal kiddo stuff). When COVID hit, we pulled him out of school and both of us started working from home full time. 

I know it's hard on my son, everyone being stuck at home but not able to spend all our time playing with him. I've tried talking to him about why we have to work, why we can't go outside a lot or see anyone. He did well with his quarantine birthday, even though he was sad. 

We also recently moved to a new house. I worried for months before the move that he would take it hard. I talked to him EXTENSIVELY about how we were moving houses, he'd be changing schools, but highlighted the great things about the new house (bigger house, bigger rooms, better back yard). He got excited, and he loves the house. 

On to the actual issue: the past week since we moved in, he has been acting out hard. Just today, he tore up a toy, flooded the sink in his bathroom (causing water to flood the hall), threw things at the house from the backyard, and yelled at both of us

With punishment, I always start out calm. I tell him what I expect, and what behavior is unacceptable. I give him the chance to correct it, and escalate as needed when he doesn't. We don't believe in hitting of any kind. Taking toys away used to have an impact, but now he just doesn't care. I don't know what to do about this. I can't watch him every minute of the day because I'm working (or just worn out). Anytime I stop watching him, he does things he KNOWS he shouldn't. 

His new school MIGHT be opening on the 11th, but they don't even know if they'll be able to. I want to send him, so he's got a more stable routine and an outlet for his energy...but also worry about his possible exposure to the virus. It feels like there's no right choice here.

&lt;p&gt;She is always wanting to hang on me, help with the little ones and I don&amp;#39;t get any peace. Her and my 2 year old share a room together yet she still comes in my room in the middle of the night. I have tried taking her back to her bed and explaining that she needs to sleep in her room. She says she is scared and doesn&amp;#39;t want to be alone. I&amp;#39;ve explained to her that she isn&amp;#39;t alone, she has her sister. I&amp;#39;ve tried to talk to her about sleeping in her room and how it is good for her and for me. That will work for a few nights but then she is back to crawling in our bed. My other two children sleep in their own beds and on rare occasions do they end up in our bed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do try to find time to spend with her coloring or playing but I&amp;#39;m so tired on not getting anytime to myself. I just need a few moments to process my activities for the day without interruption. I was an only child and I think having 4 kids is more difficult for me than I thought it would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my children and wouldn&amp;#39;t want to trade them for the world. I just want a few moments to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Hi,

My wife speaks Japanese, and I speak both English and Japanese fluently. I mentioned this in another post, but I will soon be re-integrating into my son's life as his father, fully. I think it's in all our best interest if I speak English with him and help him learn English, not only to make communication easier with me, but also for his future prospects-- knowing English and Japanese can get him a lot further in life than just English. He can do more things he would want to, I'd imagine, knowing English.

However, since he's our first kid, I don't have experience raising a child at all, let alone a child bilingually. Additionally, as it stands, he only speaks broken, 2.9-year old Japanese.

I tried hooking some good educational games on the computer for him but he is ONLY addicted to car racing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything you can recommend, games, or some interesting toys I can purchase for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendation on how to keep the balance so I can concentrate on work/ study from home and the kids can still thrive? It seems impossible to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"I need help with my 8 yo boy. He never had sleeping issues but 2-3 months ago he watched some scary videos at his mom's place and is scared to sleep alone ever since. At first, I accepted that he crawls into my bed at night when he wakes up scared (mistake I know). I slowly reduced the help to make him fall asleep and I'm now sitting on a chair in the hall until he falls asleep.

The problem is when I try to remove this crutch. He absolutely refuses to even TRY to fall asleep by himself, even if I tell him that I'll come back in 5 minutes if it doesn't work. He's refusing to make any effort. If I try to leave, he'll just leave his room and go downstairs. He will refuse to go back to his room. If I force him back, things escalate in a full-out tantrum where he will bite me, hit me, threaten to kill me, etc. I will hold the door shut so that he can't escape but he then breaks stuff in his room, kicks holes in the door, attack me if I try to intervene, etc.

This confrontation usually lasts a good 20-30 min until he loses steam. By this time I'm exhausted and I give in. I sit in the hall until he falls asleep. I just don't have the energy to go through another hell cycle.

If he wakes up at night, I will most often sit in the hall until he falls back asleep (can take more than one hour) but sometimes, like last night, I try to be firm and insist on him trying for at least 5 minutes alone. He refused so I locked myself into my room, trying to be firm. He banged into my door at midnight for a good 5-10 min until I had enough, was very pissed at him, and forced him to his room, which resulted in a full-out very violent tantrum. After things calmed down, I sat in the hall until he fell asleep. He won.

I don't know what to do anymore. Next step is putting a lock on his door and removing every breakable things in his room. That seems cruel but I don't know what to do anymore. Any other idea?

* Mom denies that there's any underlying issue beyond ""he's a typical boy""
* Started seeing a psychologist 3-4 weeks ago but hasn't helped so far (no mother collaboration)
* He also has self esteem issues. He often says ""I'm not good"", ""I can't do this"". Suffers from comparison with his 11 yo sister, he's never as good at school, as nice, as good in sports, etc.
* Tends to give up very easily. Does not like to be challenged.
* These violent tantrums can also be triggered by other things that upset him, sometimes very petty.
* It's basically impossible to put him in timeout for any reason anymore, he will always refuse to go to his room. If I force him = full out violent tantrums. The only punishment that works is taking away the ipad for a day or two.
* I have a reward system in place (stars on a chart for good behavior/chores) but it's not enough to entice him to sleep alone

We have a 2.5 year old and 6 month old. 

Our boy, the 2.5 year old, I feel is excelling in most areas. It’s just that he’s been acting up a lot lately. 

The issue is that lately he’s constantly testing us - example: wife said to stop touching the table cloth with his dirty hand and he did the slow finger descent.

When we tell him to do something, my wife does a count - pick up the toy 1, pick up the toy 2... and he always waits for the 3. I’ve read that this trains him for exactly that. So I tell him to do something and give him a consequence like timeout. 

Issue there is that he has started to be un-phased by timeouts. I got some advice from my brother who does timeouts based on age: 2 = two minutes. I’ve thought about increasing this. 

The latest thing we’ve tried to get him in-line is getting out his baby seat for dinner and letting him act out, example: he can’t meow at the dinner table, but we let him do it in his baby chair and try to not pay attention. We just started this tonight and he was dying for attention. 

The thing that bothers me the most is when he takes away toys from his little sister, but we try to handle this whenever we see it. He still does it when we aren’t looking. 

I understand this might be made worse by quarantine, but we take him on walks and car rides almost every day.

We started with grounders, proper throwing motion, catching, and then batting. Every step of improvement is immediately followed by his big cheesy smile and my own sense of pride.

Today was a really nice day and we went into the back yard like we have many times before. He carried his bat and our gloves while I carried all the wiffle balls. The difference is today he asked to try hitting without the tee. I stood fairly close to make it easier for him and held about 10 balls in my glove while tossing. Normally when he hits with the tee I award him points for different things (1 for contact, 5 for good contact, 100 if he hits the tree). As we got started he was hacking at the ball so I started to correct him. He responds with ""I know, I know, I know"" before I could finish my sentence. He continues missing and just when I was going to offer for us to play catch he makes contact and the ball zooms by my head. This is when I made a mistake.

,Parenting,"Hi guys. I am currently writing this as I am so frustrated and I don't know where else to turn to. I need advice because I am losing my mind.  
My daughter was a perfect sleeper. She started sleeping through the night at six weeks old. As she grew older I would put her to bed with a bottle and she would sleep until morning. Perfectly. Which was really lucky as I have been a solo parent since she was a newborn. However, that all changed last June (when she was 2) when I took her with me to America (we are Australian) to visit my fiance. The flight was alright but she had a few extra bottles and then some bottles for jetlag to help sleep, car trips etc. It just ruined her whole routine. Ever since then she hasn't been the same.

When we got back it was worse. She would want 1-3 bottles to fall asleep and wake up for another one to two. I didn't want to give them to her but I live with my parents which I am thankful for but we are an inconvenience to them. They don't want to hear her cry or be woken up so they insisted on me constantly giving her the bottles. However, I managed to cut them out in March and it wasn't so bad. After a week she didn't want them at all.

Now I have a whole new problem. She won't go to sleep. I guess she was used to falling asleep on the bottle that now she doesn't at all. Her routine is dinner, bath, brush teeth, two books and then bed. She goes to bed at 7:30pm. However she doesn't fall asleep until around 9-10 every single night. She constantly calls me into her room and I have to go in because my parents will not let me teach her to self soothe and my daughter now knows I will come in. She calls me for anything. She just now called me in to cut her toe nails?? Usually it's to put her lullaby music back on, tuck her sheet back in or give her a drink as she refuses to keep the bottle in her bed. Otherwise cuddles, kisses or just to say goodnight. It drives me crazy as I am always exhausted and night time is my only break. I honestly don't know what to do.

She does have a nap during the day. It used to be as long as she wanted but I cut it down from 1-3 at the most. Two hours as that is what is recommended. She doesn't seem ready to cut the nap. She falls asleep easily and without calling out during the day. I don't really want to cut it unless I really need to.

So does anyone have any advice? I am desperate. How can I get my newly three year old daughter to stop calling out for two hours? Her sleep pattern right now is bed 7:30 and she will fall asleep around 9-10. Without fail she wakes up around 1am and then again around 4-5am and I often can't get her back to sleep. It's exhausting.

I need my good sleeper back. We are moving permanently to the US soon so I know jetlag might undo some of this but I still just need some ideas that can help. I am buying a Gro Clock to maybe try to help but if anyone has any other advice. I am pretty desperate.

tl;dr: 3 year old takes over two hours to fall asleep at night and constantly calls for me. Parents won't let me ignore her/tell her to settle.

,Parenting,"Never used reddit before but i was told its a good place to get advice from ppl out in the world. 

So I've been dating my girlfriend for just about a yr. She has a four yr old son and they moved in with me about half a yr ago around Christmas, her son never had any form of discipline in his life. (aside the occasional ""dont do that"" and whether he kept doing it or not the family wouldn't care if he listened or not) so when he started living with me he was pretty out of control (imo), I explained to her before moving in that i had rules for my home and that ik he isn't my child and i wont try to act the dad route since it isnt my place (his dad is somewhat in the picture) but that the rules of my home will be followed. She agreed and so I was happy with them moving in, unfortunately i feel she didn't understand what i meant.

In the past 6 months the child has become more and more defiant, he refuses to listen to his mother, when i ask him who he has to listen to he says that he only has to listen to his grandmother (gf's aunt) and his 2 aunts (gf's cousins) as he spent his first 3 yrs living with them and his mother, problem is that my gf's aunt is the matriarch of their family and pushed anything my gf said to him aside and would make him listen to her (the ""grandmother"") which made him think that ""mom"" can be walked all over, talked down to, and be completely ignored. Sorry for the tangent, so when they moved in and i saw how unruly he was i sat her down and told her things need to change. I explained how I want her to teach him the meaning and power the title of mom is supposed to hold on a child. she agreed to do that and began putting him in timeouts, as that was the only form of punishment that made him listen (albeit for very brief period of time). it was so shocking to him in the beginning that when he went to visit his gma again after about a month he ran off, hid and cried when his mom said it was time to leave and come back. after that incident he has tried doing the same thing two more times. A few weeks ago his gma said something to my gf in front of him about having to spend some time with him while hes in bed and he took it as a command for his mom to sleep together with him and has ever since been crying, throwing tantrums, and refusing to go to sleep by his bedtime, typically will fall asleep 2 hrs later after being talked to multiple times and being put on TO subsequently. its been so consistent that ive pretty much had it already because I dont know where im supposed to step in, or stay on the side and watch it all unravel. i tried to talk to him and calm him down, explain that he needs to sleep alone, but lately ive been so sick of his behavior I just refuse to talk or play with him. 

I've had other relationships with women that had children before, always ended due to me not being able to handle watching from the side and let bad behavior fester, I don't really know what to do.

,Parenting,"I (40M) and my wife (37F) have a 4 year old daughter and a 3 month old son.  I’ve read so many posts about how your heart expands when another child is born and you’ll be amazed at how much more love you had to give than you thought possible, etc.  I do love my new son but it’s been three months now and the love I have for him is not even close to the love I have for my daughter.

She and I have always been super close, and she is the apple of my eye.  Every day she amuses and amazes me, and I cherish her so very much.  When she was born there wasn’t any sort of magical connection, but I did feel a desire to be very hands on and involved with her.  And over the years my love for her has grown so that I can’t imagine what life would be like without her.

I do love my son, but I’m not nearly as interested in holding him all the time as I was with my daughter, or snuggling him all day.  I am quite happy to have him around, help out as much as I need to, and spend just a few minutes of pure time with him each day.  I don’t know if it’s because his sister takes up so much of my attention, or if I’m just worn out this second go around.

Interestingly, my wife wasn’t ever that bonded with our daughter (though she loves her very much) and is much more bonded with our son.  I’m really happy to see her getting the same sort of baby love that I did with our daughter, we’ve always been sad that she didn’t get that.

Overall it feels like our family is in a good place, my wife and I are both happy with the distribution of labor and involvement with each child, both kids are happy.  And I hope that my love for him will explode one day and I will feel that bond, but I worry about what if it doesn’t...it might feel very sad to know deep down that I really prefer one child over the other.  Or maybe there’s a way I could accept that and still be a great father to each in different ways.

It feels unfair to compare a 4 year old to a baby because I’ve had 4 years to get to know my daughter.  And my son only started smiling two weeks ago. But I’ve heard so many things about not worrying before he was born because I would immediately love the second as much as the first.  I’ve not read a single thing about someone needing time to warm up to the second.

,Parenting," Hi all! So, I have an incredibly bright 3 year old boy. I am a single parent and we live in an apartment. My son had shown me once or twice proudly that he’d pulled out a few hairs from his head, which I had thought he’d accidentally done but thought was neat or something. He has been exposed to an undue amount of stress due to his father’s behaviour (and my part of the trouble for not enforcing the boundaries to keep dad away).   
So, all had been going well with dad recently, but he had a big drama baloo last week, and I didn’t think the situation through to the end, and said dad could stay with us for 4 days. On day 3 dad started losing it, and I shut down the situation to get him out of there, but kiddo was still exposed to all that at home (including dad going on about being suicidal), and then the drive to drop dad off somewhere else, him yelling at his mom on the phone, etc, etc.   
Now, dad is all evened out again (for now), but, my son has shown me 2 or 3 more times that he’s pulled out his hair, and I thought he was rubbing at dirt in his eyes once, but he informed me he liked pulling his eyebrows/eyelashes. I also keep catching him trying to nibble on his finger nails now, after seeing his grandma do it.   
This, on top of the fact that I learned yesterday my son feels ‘very worried’ about the corona virus. I am very much doing my best, which clearly isn’t good enough given the circumstances surrounding our life.   
I really want to help him get control of this hair pulling now, and would love any advice for managing it. It says online that the sense of ‘pressure, followed by pleasure’ after pulling is a factor. I also read that in some cases fixing vitamin d issues worked as a fix for children. I have also read that it’s something to do with a lack of serotonin. And obviously, stress.   
Vitamin D shouldn’t be a problem now that it’s summer (as long as I’m visiting my mom, or his dad, who have yards). I am going to absolutely push more pork, beef and eggs, and was actually about to grab Spirulina for myself, so I’ll get some for him as well. We talk a lot about stress, the negative voice in our head, etc, but clearly I need an additional approach. I have also informed dad that we absolutely can not take him again in or around a time of crisis/stress.   
So - any advice from anyone else? Vitamins? Games? Books? Ways to talk about it? Do I jump to get a diagnosis for kiddo’s or court’s sake (We are also mid custody fight)? Techniques or toys or activities that offer kids that particular sense of control?

So, I have an incredibly bright 3 year old boy. I am a single parent and we live in an apartment. My son had shown me once or twice proudly that he’d pulled out a few hairs from his head, which I had thought he’d accidentally done but thought was neat or something. He has been exposed to an undue amount of stress due to his father’s behaviour (and my part of the trouble for not enforcing the boundaries to keep dad away).&lt;br/&gt;
So, all had been going well with dad recently, but he had a big drama baloo last week, and I didn’t think the situation through to the end, and said dad could stay with us for 4 days. On day 3 dad started losing it, and I shut down the situation to get him out of there, but kiddo was still exposed to all that at home (including dad going on about being suicidal), and then the drive to drop dad off somewhere else, him yelling at his mom on the phone, etc, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
Now, dad is all evened out again (for now), but, my son has shown me 2 or 3 more times that he’s pulled out his hair, and I thought he was rubbing at dirt in his eyes once, but he informed me he liked pulling his eyebrows/eyelashes. I also keep catching him trying to nibble on his finger nails now, after seeing his grandma do it.&lt;br/&gt;
This, on top of the fact that I learned yesterday my son feels ‘very worried’ about the corona virus. I am very much doing my best, which clearly isn’t good enough given the circumstances surrounding our life.&lt;br/&gt;
I really want to help him get control of this hair pulling now, and would love any advice for managing it. It says online that the sense of ‘pressure, followed by pleasure’ after pulling is a factor. I also read that in some cases fixing vitamin d issues worked as a fix for children. I have also read that it’s something to do with a lack of serotonin. And obviously, stress.&lt;br/&gt;
Vitamin D shouldn’t be a problem now that it’s summer (as long as I’m visiting my mom, or his dad, who have yards). I am going to absolutely push more pork, beef and eggs, and was actually about to grab Spirulina for myself, so I’ll get some for him as well. We talk a lot about stress, the negative voice in our head, etc, but clearly I need an additional approach. I have also informed dad that we absolutely can not take him again in or around a time of crisis/stress.&lt;br/&gt;
So - any advice from anyone else? Vitamins? Games? Books? Ways to talk about it? Do I jump to get a diagnosis for kiddo’s or court’s sake (We are also mid custody fight)? Techniques or toys or activities that offer kids that particular sense of control?&lt;br/&gt;

My parents were deported after being in the US for 20 years and are now seeking asylum. I have been a parent to my sister for 8 months back in 2018, and now, she is with me once again. She’s been with me since I had to pick her up from CPS after my parents turned themselves in on Feb 2020. 

For the first few weeks, it was all good! She would obey me (I live with my boyfriends family) and obey  the people I live with. She would ask for things nicely, she did not give me an attitude, etc. She would behave and it would be all fine...up until a couple of weeks ago. 

My sister now demands things from me from time to time. For example, if we go to the store, she’ll say “you have to buy me this” or “I will have this”. I, of course, sometimes buy it, but I mostly don’t (she’s already gone through so much as a child, I want her to know that I’m here for her).  Or when she’s hungry, “make me food now”. 
She’s also been quite rude. If I’m talking to my boyfriend, she will get mad, make a rude remark like “I don’t like you”, slam the door and go to her room.  She also does thing thing after she gets mad, she’ll say “you don’t like me” or “why do you hate me so much”. 

One more thing she does which bothers people in the house I’m living with, she walks around the house in the middle of the night. Either to get food, get up and try to find her electronics, etc. 
I take away the iPad and Nintendo switch at 10:30pm. After that, no electronics. Straight to bed. She gives me an attitude and then starts crying about how she misses her parents and how she wishes she wasn’t living in this house anymore. 

I’m already struggling mentally and emotionally with everything going on with my parents, it’s hard to keep up with trying to discipline her. I mean, it’s hard because I still see her as a sister, but it hasn’t gone through my head that I am now her legal guardian. Her parent. 

Before all this happened, I was very dependent on my parents (I was 18). Then all of a sudden, I was a parent. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve put her in time out, taken away her toys, her electronics, have given her bedtimes from 9pm or 10pm, extended her timeout and the “no electronics” until the next day.

My dear little one is turning 6 weeks soon, and whilst he is sleeping quite well at night (from 10pm to 9am, waking up every 2 hours for feeds) he just doesn't want to sleep during the day. He is quite alert and happy (although doesn't smile yet!) in the morning but from 2pm to 9pm it's usually a lot of crying between breastfeeding and micro naps of 10 to 20 minutes. The crying is very intense with Pain like face. I'm wondering if it's just the ""colic"" phase or if there's something wrong? He is also becoming quite fussy at the boob so we had to supplement with formula which helps a bit with sleeping.

We just can't get him to sleep more than that. We've tried swaddling, white noise, baby carriers, everything... he is just very fussy during the day. It's taking a big toll on us as we can't get anything done at all during the day.

So - something else that’s been on mind is that I think I want a third baby. Hubby and I are both on the fence about it. We’ve gone back and forth all year on this. We feel like we’ve just gotten out of the baby baby stage and we can finally do things easier after having two babies only 17mths apart. Given we’ve never even actually travelled with a baby or toddler, I wanted to hear others experience about how difficult it is traveling with kids &lt;5. Will adding a younger baby make it that much more difficult than just the older two toddlers? Am I making it a bigger thing than it is?!

We’re obviously not basing our entire decision to have baby 3 on whether we can travel, but I’m interested to hear experiences on traveling with young kids in general. Inability to travel is one of the top things on my “cons” list for baby 3 - maybe some baby traveling experts can convince me it’s not all doom and gloom to travel with young kids!",t2_141iwjn2,False,,0,False,Traveling with toddlers and babies,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Travel'}]",r/Parenting,False,6,travel,0,False,t3_gd2da3,False,light,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Travel,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588584430.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Parenting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to hear experiences on traveling with young kids &amp;lt;5 please!

,Parenting,"My daughter is 3yo and the youngest of my three kids. She is by far the worst and most clingy sleeper. 

Don’t get me wrong,  none of my kids have been great sleepers as young toddlers and babies but by this point my other kids has figured out sleeping at least SOME. 

Actually with my boys they went down pretty easily and after the stopped nursing at night they only woke once and crawled in my bed during the wee hours of the morning.

My daughter wakes up several times a night. She is SO hard to settled and actually get to sleep. Her bedtime routine takes HOURS. And sometimes it still doesn’t work. 

Tonight it took over 4 hours, 5 books, 4 potty trips, lots of screaming and crying and 5mg of melatonin. It was still after midnight before she fell asleep. 

And it’s not just that she won’t go to sleep. She wants me to lay with her while she suffocates me. She rolls all over me. She tangles her hands in my hair. She kicks the covers off but then demands them again. She wants the fan off and then on again.

We’ve tried a sound machine. Sleep music. Hypnosis sleep stories. 
EVERYTHING. 

She drives me freakin nuts. 

Tonight I had to walk away out of pure frustration. She cried and screamed. I tried to calm her down and walked away again. She screamed more. Finally she settled and fell asleep without being on top of me, but I’m pretty sure she thought me laying beside her was better than me leaving completely. 

She eats a good diets and gets plenty of outside time. 

We’ve tried starting bedtime earlier and later. 
Nothing works. 

If she doesn’t nap she will go to bed earlier but it still takes forever. 

If she does nap it’s usually super late and more of a pain to get her to bed at night. 

Really though without a nap she can’t make it past 5pm. And then we risk her taking a nap between 5-7pm and then we are really screwed.

This has never been an issue before, our routines worked quite well since she started sleeping alone at 1.5 years.
But since March she either can't seem to fall asleep or is afraid of ""being alone"" in her room. No amount of hand holding, night light or assuring that we're just in the next room seem to work very well.

She doesn't want/can't say what's wrong, we assume there were some nightmares from what she's telling. Yesterday she said she didn't like her room anymore... half her things are there, she likes playing there and at naptime she's out like a light in 2 minutes? It's just the nights.
We cut back naptime to 1 hour, but she's extremely tired around noon so we think she might still need that. It doesn't seem to matter when we put her to bed, she needs at least an hour to doze off, be it 7, 8 or even 9 or 10pm, crying again at 2 or 3am. Then it's another hour until she can sleep. She really tries most days, but just can't calm down. Most nights she ends up in our bed, it seems to be easier for her there.

,Parenting,"My SO for some reason refuses to think outside the box when it comes to our almost 4 year old.

When it comes to him putting her to sleep, instead of redirecting when she doesn't want to lay down, and is having a tantrum, he decides it is better to just yell and argue with her. Since we take turns putting her to bed, I end up there most of the time because she wants me, cause of all the yelling.

When I put her to bed, if she tries to pull anything I am able to redirect her tantrum and get her to lay down.

For day to day stuff it is the same way. He just wants her to do what he says, and i get that, me too. I just think sometimes redirecting her to change her mood and to get her to listen is the better approach, because it actually works for her.

He doesn't like to be told that he could be doing anything differently then his current approach, and gets defensive. I am just like, but is it working? Does it really change what is happening.

His new deal is taking her out of bed and putting her in time out if she doesnt listen, which creates more crying. She hasn't napped in 2 months due to being home 24/7 so she is extra tired at night and is more resistant to bedtime.

My son is 4½. He was diagnosed with autism; developmental and speech delay, and feeding issues a few months before he turned 2 (because I insisted he new tested for autism &amp; even made the appts for all of his issues). Very recently, he's been whining, screaming to the top of his lungs, and throwing/breaking things. His dad &amp; I are separated but his dad is truly making a d$#k moves, truly evil when you really think about it, to have this kind of hate or spite is just cruel for the collateral damage. We've already gone thru the court custody battle and we were done a year ago. He's already taking me back to court because he's asking for full custody, lying, I can back up every lie he's told, I mean Pre-Trial, the judge told him he wouldn't be changing anything if there wasn't anything significant. The lie first started with the salt, but the story grew and grew every court visit because the judge kept saying saying the same thing, oversleeping and having your kid pour salt everywhere 🤣. This was his house after our breakup so it's not as child proof as mine is because I'm extra when it comes to his safety. Our son had (until recently) daily ABA after Pre-K. I don't know what's going on at his dad's and my issue is that he never trusted me (an RN). I have 3 adult children who grew up in a real family home, never any atypical issues. He legit lost his kids in the woods TWICE because he has a gaming addiction. And I'm a gamer. A real gamer, we played in many co-op, MMO games together. He had over 100 HOURS in a 2 WEEK period. His kids are also almost adults now too and they hate him, they told me to my face. He winded up giving up his parents rights. And the opposite for me. He didn't want to parent our son at first either but after his arrest for assault and battery, DCF entered into our lives, he was mandated to take a 42 week long battery course (I found out after that this was not his 1st A&amp;B). So I sometimes worry about our speechless son. But we've also had 2 years of mandated reporters either in our homes or in their offices. We got back together after the Trial for a bit but it wasn't working out for either of us &amp; because I hate confrontation, I left without saying a word. It's just that the 1st time we have sex, he talks like we've made a commitment to each other and I was a douche for not correcting that (i really liked the sex).  Mandated Reporters. Every Week Day. I was recently told that I'm a ""great mom."" And, You're Super Mom."" He needs for nothing at both homes.

He was great at it before but until we had to cut his ABA recently &amp; no school, he's out of control and I am doing my best for him but it's hard. How can I help our son? What besides #socialdistancing could be causing these new behaviors? What should I be doing? Also when he's not watching smoke detectors and fire alarms on YouTube, he's making the sound of an alarm and this is on the main TV for the past 2 weeks or so. Alarms, that's what I hear when we're home and he's not in the mood for. It's driving me nuts. I use one earbud and do my mommy things so I can still hear him and not cut off my ears. 😭 I do spoil him but I also discipline him the way the ABA providers taught me.

,Parenting,"My son is 6 months as of this week. He’s a happy boy mostly, thriving and meeting all his milestones but he is very high needs.

He has had colic and slept and fed awfully from the outset which made the newborn period incredibly challenging. The colic has resolved but he continues to have significant reflux which he’s on special formula for (medicines didn’t work for long). So the past few months he has been super fussy with each bottle. My paediatrician gave it a name of bottle aversion secondary to severe reflux. 

So as a result of the colic and poor sleeping, we used to rock and bounce the kiddo to sleep and often fed him to sleep. 
Now because of the reflux we gently bounce, as often that’s the only way he will feed and/or sleep. Most days he doesn’t need as much rocking or bouncing during the day for feeds or naps but the last nap and bedtime are always a struggle. 
After these efforts thankfully he manages to drink a good normal amount of milk that he’s supposed to for his age/weight. 

In terms of sleep - my kiddo wakes up 2-2.5 hourly. Most times he will feed an ounce or two and then go back to sleep. Without a feed, he will not settle, cry hysterically and be awake for hours. 

Multiple conversations with people lately has resulted in me being told that I’m crazy to still rock/bounce at 6 months and  I’ve ruined/spoiled my baby as a result. That sleeping to feed will cause long term behavioural/sleep issues. That I need to re-evaluate my parenting because I respond to the crying too soon, attend to him too quickly and co-sleep and that Ive created a high needs baby by accommodating for the fussiness. That I should let him fuss and/or starve for each feed so he can learn to get over it all on his own. 
And also that I could fix the feeding/reflux and sleep issues if I sucked it up and decided to sleep train (which currently I do not want to do so please do not recommend this as a solution).

I’m exhausted from the sleeplessness and parenting more or less solo. I’m overwhelmed by trying to be the perfect parent. And now I feel ashamed/guilty for failing at the latter. 

I mean, to be fair to people - is it normal for a formula fed 6 month old to be waking 2-3 hourly still? Everywhere says he should be sleeping longer stretches, through the night even? 
My son had his 6 month checkup and he’s doing swimmingly so *I* must be doing something wrong? Have I ruined/spoiled him with the bouncing and attending to him?

Just looking for some reassurance and guidance and personal stories (again!).

TIA.

He’s a happy boy mostly, thriving and meeting all his milestones but he is very high needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has had colic and slept and fed awfully from the outset which made the newborn period incredibly challenging. The colic has resolved but he continues to have significant reflux which he’s on special formula for (medicines didn’t work for long). So the past few months he has been super fussy with each bottle. My paediatrician gave it a name of bottle aversion secondary to severe reflux. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a result of the colic and poor sleeping, we used to rock and bounce the kiddo to sleep and often fed him to sleep. 
Now because of the reflux we gently bounce, as often that’s the only way he will feed and/or sleep. Most days he doesn’t need as much rocking or bouncing during the day for feeds or naps but the last nap and bedtime are always a struggle. 
After these efforts thankfully he manages to drink a good normal amount of milk that he’s supposed to for his age/weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sleep - my kiddo wakes up 2-2.5 hourly. Most times he will feed an ounce or two and then go back to sleep. Without a feed, he will not settle, cry hysterically and be awake for hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple conversations with people lately has resulted in me being told that I’m crazy to still rock/bounce at 6 months and  I’ve ruined/spoiled my baby as a result. That sleeping to feed will cause long term behavioural/sleep issues. That I need to re-evaluate my parenting because I respond to the crying too soon, attend to him too quickly and co-sleep and that Ive created a high needs baby by accommodating for the fussiness. That I should let him fuss and/or starve for each feed so he can learn to get over it all on his own.

,Parenting,"Hey guys! I have a 5yo and 9yo daughter. With all this COVID-19 stuff going on (and me being an essential worker and still working) my mom has been helping me during the weekdays watching my kids. She has them most of the day throughout the week and every once in awhile keeps them a night or two during the week if I work late, but they are always with me for the weekends which I have off. At my moms house their room is up a flight of about 10-12 stairs, and in my apartment our bedrooms are also up a flight of about 10 stairs. They’ve never been an issue before (we’ve lived here since July 2019) and even in our old house prior there were two flights of stairs to get up to the main living area. Also never a problem! About a month and a half ago my 5yo seemed to suddenly develop a fear of all the stairs. She always wants somebody to help her down (all the stair cases have hand rails), and if anybody else is going up or down at the same time she always insists on going last. I asked my mom if she wiped out on the stairs at her place one day or something, but she hasn’t. Several months ago (probably around Thanksgiving?) she did miss the bottom stair once and hit her butt pretty hard, but even after that it was never an issue until recently.

My mom has asked her several times why she is scared of the stairs and all she says is “I don’t know.” I’ve asked her the same thing with the same response, but Friday night she did tell me she was “scared of falling down the stairs”. I asked why, and she just shrugged. I asked if she had fallen down the stairs before, and she said no, but it just seems to be getting worse. A few minutes ago I was cleaning the living room and heard her hemming and hawing upstairs and asked if she was okay, and she said “I just can’t go down the stairs!” And I peeked up and she was sitting on the top stair holding on to the railing. I told her to just scoot down one by one on her bottom if that made her feel better, and eventually she did come down. Has this happened to anybody else?

The 15F child lives with us 100% of the time, she doesn’t want anything to do with her Mom. I should mention that I do not have any children of my own, the only kids on my life are my partner’s children who I love very much. 

The other day 15F admitted to me that she took her Dad’s phone when he and I first met and read our text messages. She said she also did this with previous girlfriends he’s had over the years. There’s been a few times I’ve come home to find my papers have been moved or looked thorough (bills, prescriptions, letters, etc). She is known in the family for being a “snoop”, but nobody seems to think it’s serious enough to discipline her for. Whatever, she’s not my kid, and its not my place to discipline her. 

But for the last few months, we’ve caught her spying on us many times. She sneaks down the stairs and sits on the stairwell, watching us and listening to our conversations. She even told us she does this. Her very passive father (47M) doesn’t really say much about it. He certainly does’t punish her in any way whatsoever. 

I’m not sure what to do in this situation. I don’t want to overstep my bounds but this sneaky behaviour is really bothering me.

,Parenting,"So my son is approaching 6 years old. His mother and I split almost immediately after he was born. From that point onward it was nothing but constant struggle and strife.

Custody battles, pissing contests and boatloads of drama ensued. It took me almost a full year to win access because of the hearings getting dragged out, and another year to get week-about access. A year after that I won custody during the school year with his mom getting weekends and split summers. This is where we sit now, except with us all isolating we have been fast and loose with access as our school routine is shot for now.

My ex has 7 Kids, 4 older, our son, then 2 twins born just around Christmas.

The last 5 years have been a cycle of conflict and a short period of civility between them. The last few months though I had noticed a change in my ex. I'm trying to pick my words carefully because I'm not looking to frame her as the bad guy. Her life is just really hectic and it became clear in court that I could simply provide a better focus on our son in the school year. She was pretty hurt by the decision and resentful. Some of our conflicts were clearly motivated by that resentment, but that's pretty human, so I don't hold it against her much.

Back to the point though, I had noticed her being more co-operative, kinder... friendly even. Now I didn't think much at first, but after the civility kept on for multiple months I couldn't help but hope this would be the new normal.

Over the past few days we've been talking and I guess her marriage had been declining. Don't get the wrong idea, she's not looking for, nor am I looking to be a plan B.

Struggling with all that I guess really helped to put things in to perspective for her. Helped her see my motivations were not of spite, but in the genuine best interest of everyone involved. Now with the lockdown she is swamped and is actually really thankful that I am so dedicated to our son. Unfortunately the other dad's are not really involved, including the newest one.

Out of nowhere she told me today that: ""You are a great dad and our son is so lucky to have you. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but you set the standard by which I judge other men as a father."" I think today I can confidently say we have reached a plateau in co-parenting. What a massive relief to imagine that a half decade of all consuming conflict is behind us.

I just wanted to share the relief I feel in all this. Sometimes its so hard to co-parent when you don't get along. I'm not going to lay all the blame solely at her feet. My expectations are maybe a bit high sometimes, but for her to say those words to me *in writing* is actually a pretty big deal for someone as proud as she is.

,Parenting,"This post is about my postpartum depression, so if that is triggering for anyone I recommend not reading. It took me a while to be able to even talk about it, and I would not want to upset anyone who currently suffers from it.

Also, I'm sorry this is so long. I just need to get it all out because it's been nearly 4 years and lately I've been feeling it hard...

I am a mother of a 3, almost 4, year old boy. My pregnancy was terrible, like many people's, and I could not wait to just get this thing out of me. I couldn't wait to have this new chapter of my life start. But when he finally arrived, I felt... numb. The lead up to his birth was weird as well so I thought for a bit that the actual birth and postpartum stay was anticlimactic because of that. One nurse did my IV wrong, the anesthesiologist botched the epidural so he had to redo it, the other nurse had me start pushing at 9cm while my OB was with someone else in another room. It all felt hectic and weird but simultaneously like ""eh... whatever. It's almost over.""

And then I started pushing. It didn't take long. I wasn't cursing out my significant other or screaming or anything. My son had the cord wrapped around his neck but I was born the same way so it didn't phase me. He didn't cry right away so they whisked him off to the other side of the room to get him breathing. But I felt nothing. I birthed the placenta, my OB stitched me up, my son started breathing and crying. They put him on me for the first time, I looked down at him. Nothing.

I thought I was just in shock or exhausted or something. They got me into a wheelchair, still holding my son, and brought me to the postpartum wing. My improperly done IV leaked blood the whole way and no one noticed until we got there and I said it hurt. (As a side note, I will never return to that hospital...) I sat on a toilet for at least an hour trying to pee but I obviously couldn't feel the lower half of my body at all so it took a while. I also had no concept of time at this point; everything is a blur. I just know it took forever.

I finally got into the bed in the postpartum wing, my son latched like a champ and drank his fill. That was the only time we got him to latch. The lactation consultant gave up on me after a few weak attempts and no one told me when their shift ended. My son didn't eat for hours despite us paging the nurses every half hour for someone to help us feed him. But that's a complaint for another post I suppose... We got him bottle feeding and he was fine.

My significant other did most of the caring for the baby. I slept. A LOT. Even when I was awake, I didn't want to hold him. I was in so much pain and discomfort from the tearing and I didn't understand why people weren't more sympathetic to that. It didn't compute in my mind that I was supposed to be completely in mom mode and I felt absolutely nothing.

On the final day before we were discharged, I looked at my mother who was visiting and said ""Something isn't right."" She got a nurse immediately, we talked, postpartum depression came up. They immediately got a psychologist in, I filled out a survey. They booked me to stay for another day, with my son even though he was still discharged on time. They scheduled appointments for me with a therapist and a psychiatrist for the upcoming week.

I did everything I needed to as a parent in spite of struggling with PPD. My SO did very little aside from staying up at night, but that's also a topic for a different post. It was more or less my sole responsibility to care for this child that I felt nothing other than a vague obligation to care for. I cried more than anything else. I cried while I fed him, I cried while I rocked him, I cried on the way to his pediatrician appointments. I slept like a rock at night and felt no motivation to get up when I would hear him cry, even when it was my turn to care for him.

I should note that I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was a teenager and have been struggling with those my entire life. So that combined with the PPD was almost unbearable. I wanted to die. I never wanted to harm my son though. I didn't feel compassion towards him but I felt no ill will either. He was just a baby; it wasn't his fault my brain was working the way that it was.

I felt the numbness towards him less and less over time; months and years of time. It wasn't until around when he turned 3 that I finally felt confident in saying I no longer suffered from PPD. I still felt, and feel to this day, the regular ups and downs that come with being a parent. But now? Now I miss him when I'm away or when he's sleeping. I smile genuinely when he giggles and acts silly. I love him so much, this little man he has become. I keep looking over at him as I'm typing this and I can finally feel my heart swell with love the way it's supposed to.

I don't want to have more kids. Between how awful the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum were I just couldn't handle doing it again. But I'll be damned if I don't wish I could go back and experience that moment differently; when they put him on my chest and I looked down at his weird little face. I wish I could have smiled and meant it. Welcomed him into the world with love.

&lt;p&gt;I did everything I needed to as a parent in spite of struggling with PPD. My SO did very little aside from staying up at night, but that&amp;#39;s also a topic for a different post. It was more or less my sole responsibility to care for this child that I felt nothing other than a vague obligation to care for. I cried more than anything else. I cried while I fed him, I cried while I rocked him, I cried on the way to his pediatrician appointments. I slept like a rock at night and felt no motivation to get up when I would hear him cry, even when it was my turn to care for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was a teenager and have been struggling with those my entire life. So that combined with the PPD was almost unbearable. I wanted to die. I never wanted to harm my son though. I didn&amp;#39;t feel compassion towards him but I felt no ill will either. He was just a baby; it wasn&amp;#39;t his fault my brain was working the way that it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the numbness towards him less and less over time; months and years of time. It wasn&amp;#39;t until around when he turned 3 that I finally felt confident in saying I no longer suffered from PPD. I still felt, and feel to this day, the regular ups and downs that come with being a parent. But now? Now I miss him when I&amp;#39;m away or when he&amp;#39;s sleeping. I smile genuinely when he giggles and acts silly. I love him so much, this little man he has become. I keep looking over at him as I&amp;#39;m typing this and I can finally feel my heart swell with love the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to have more kids. Between how awful the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum were I just couldn&amp;#39;t handle doing it again. But I&amp;#39;ll be damned if I don&amp;#39;t wish I could go back and experience that moment differently; when they put him on my chest and I looked down at his weird little face. I wish I could have smiled and meant it. Welcomed him into the world with love. I wish I could do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Hi all! My son is just over 3 months old, and I'm thinking about how to move away from feeding him to sleep, but have no idea how to do so.

He falls asleep independently for pretty much all naps (sometimes there's a late afternoon one he's too worked up for so I wear him, but less and less these days), so I know he's capable of doing it - he has a range of self soothing techniques, like head rubbing, slamming his legs down onto the crib, and sucking his fingers. We don't have much of a routine - nappy change, chill in the nursery together (blinds closed) in silence/low voice talk for a few minutes, sleep sack and dummy. The past 2 days I've tried to add reading a book during our chill time with the thought that I'd do the same at bedtime. He naps on average 4-5h a day.

However, I got into a bad habit of feeding him to sleep at night - when I was in survival mode those first few weeks I just did whatever worked, but now I'm trying to move away from it (ideally before the 4 month regression hits!). Our ""bedtime routine"" (again not much of a routine) is (bath if bath day but we don't do it regularly yet), nappy change, into pjs, side-lying nurse in the dark. By this point he usually falls pretty much 99% asleep at the boob, and I transfer him to his crib. If he wakes up during the transfer it's very brief and he'll go back to sleep pretty quickly. He sleeps on average 10h a night.

So how do I move away from this to put *something* (book?) between nursing and sleeping? Do I wake him back up? I feel like that's likely to rile him up and he won't sleep well. Do I do it slowly by keeping him up for like 2mn one night, then 5mn another, etc.? How long do you need between ""feed"" and ""sleep"" to avoid the sleep crutch?

Baby's sleep is sort of my obsession, even though he's a pretty decent sleeper (mostly independent sleep for naps, sleeps in his crib at night, night wakings only take 15mn ish because he's an efficient eater and I have a fast letdown), so I'm *really* keen to establish good habits as soon as possible.

,Parenting,"Hi all,

After we pulled our 2yo son out of daycare die to the lockdown, he has been waking up earlier every day. Today he woke up at 415am. He has traditionally been an excellent sleeper, going to bed at 7 and wake up at 6 like clockwork. I think it is a combination of getting less exercise/stimulation and being excited to be with mama and Baba all day.

He is tall and can vault out of his crib, even though I've dropped the mattress to the floor. He will open the door and start crying loudly before he reaches our door. It will sometimes wake our 5mo son (another reason we want to regain that sleep!).

We try to tell him to go back to bed, or have one of us lie down in his room to comfort him, but he always fusses and gets up. He is clearly still tired - as I'm writing this, he is sleeping on me on the couch, something he hasn't done in months. 

We try to tire him out, we played a bit of soccer yesterday and built a water table for him to play with. He falls asleep just fine and is ready to sleep at his normal bed time. He just wakes up at ungodly hours.

Any advice, from one exhausted parent to another?

&gt; Huge warning for everyone wo gets anxious about the Corona topic!  
&gt;  
&gt;I really hope this won't get deleted, and I'm trying to make this as much about my own daughter as I can.  
&gt;  
&gt;My 9 year old daughter just found out from her best friend that her best friend's mom has the virus. The mom is a nurse and we live in one of the most affected states in the US. She's apparently been sick for a couple days and got her test results today. I don't know any details other than that the mom is not in the hospital and apparently currently in ""mild"" condition.  
&gt;  
&gt;My daughter's best friend is 9 as well, they are in 3rd grade together, she just texted her the news.  
&gt;  
&gt;My daughter is super worried for her friend and her family (mom, dad, 5 year old brother). She's crying in her room right now and keeps asking me if there's anything we can do. She knows it's not that severe for most kids, but she's still scared of her friend dying or losing one of her family members.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have NO idea how to comfort her. Is there anything I can say or do to make it better? Should I let her take the rest of day off from home-schooling (we've still got an hour or so to go) or just call home-schooling quits for all kids today? I'm leaning towards yes. I just stepped outside her room to type this because I feel like everything I can come up with to say now would kind of just make it worse. I don't want her to be traumatized by this event. What can I do to support her through this, emotionally? And how can we emotionally support her best friend and her family?  
&gt;  
&gt;I really hope this isn't going to get deleted and I also really hope I didn't trigger anyone's anxiety. Sorry, guys. Just really need something to say to my 9 year old 

I wanted to give you guys an update on how it went, and thank you for your advice and suggestions!

First of all, an update on my daughter\`s friend\`s mom: She is still in mild condition (about a week after starting to show symptoms now) and does not require hospital care at this time. However, all family members (the husband, the 9 year old and the 5 year old) are showing some symptoms now. Neither of them are in danger right now, especially not the kids, but they haven\`t been sick for very long, so, we\`ll see. The parents are in their mid-to-late 30s and aside from the dad being a smoker and slightly overweight, they don\`t have any health conditions.

After going on reddit for advice last time, I cancelled home-schooling for that day for my 14 and 11 year old (and asked them to watch the youngest). Then, I went back to my daughter\`s room to talk to her. I told her I wanted to be there for her and that she could tell me everything she\`s feeling right now. I asked her what\`s going on in her mind and heart.

She cried a lot, and we hugged for a long time. She told me that she was extremely worried that something could happen to her friend\`s mom or the rest of the family. I told her that they\`re all fairly young and will most likely just feel shitty for a few days, and that it will almost certainly be mild for the kids. I asked her why she\`s so afraid of them dying (she knows people can die from it because she has asked me lots of questions about the pandemic and I answered them all as honest as I could without freaking her out too much). She then showed me the text messages from her friend. 

Her friend was absolutely freaking out, mainly because it was her own family that\`s affected, and she texted my daughter stuff like ""What if my mommy dies?"". She apparently knows about Covid deaths from her parents. My daughter\`s best friend isn\`t the type of child who can openly talk to her parents, since she doesn\`t want to overburden her mom, and her dad often yells at her for crying and stuff like that (something I have talked to him about, but we aren\`t really all that close). Anyway, it seems like my daughter was the only one she could share her anxiety with. I told my daughter that it\`s great that she\`s there for her best friend in such a tough situation, but that she should always step out if she feels like she can\`t handle it anymore and doesn\`t have to feel guilty about that.

My daughter told me that she hates seeing her friend go through something so terrible. She also told me that knowing someone with the virus made it much more real to her, and that she can\`t see it as something that\`s far away anymore (obviously paraphrasing, she is only 9 and had a lot of trouble putting that into words).  I told her that I understand. I also told her that, after they\`ve all recovered, she might be less scared because she sees it\`s something that people can and do recover from.

After the conversation, I asked my kids to spend some time together, and my 11 year old son and her went to his room and played there. During that time, I called the best friend\`s mom. I checked in with her about her condition. It was very obvious that she was sick, but she assured me it isn\`t life-threatening and right now she\`s just staying home trying to get through it. I told her about what had happened with her daughter, and she felt really bad and said she would try to calm her down as much as she can. I asked if  they needed anything, and she said they\`re running low on groceries, since none of them have left the house since she first showed symptoms. I told my daughter and we picked up some food and basic necessities from the grocery store. At home, we cooked them some food, signed a little self-made ""get well"" card with a picture drawn by my daughter, and then we dropped all of that off at their front porch. 

Yesterday, we tried to keep everything as normal as possible, but we spent more time on our journal entry sharing time than we usually do (we have Corona journals and write a page every day, to share it with everyone else on the table during home-schooling). 

Speaking of home-schooling, though, the schools open on Monday and I don\`t know what to do. My 14 year old desperately wants to go to school and see her friends while the others absolutely do not, and I can\`t exactly send my oldest if the others don\`t consent, since everyone else in the family gets the virus if she gets it. Plus, I don\`t think it\`s safe to send them anyway, do you think I should just keep them all home? Home-schooling isn\`t a problem for me per se, I just don\`t want to throw my 14 year old\`s needs under the bus.

Thanks for reading my update. Could you give me some feedback on how I handled it and what I could do better if that happened again in the future?

I asked her why she`s so afraid of them dying (she knows people can die from it because she has asked me lots of questions about the pandemic and I answered them all as honest as I could without freaking her out too much). She then showed me the text messages from her friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her friend was absolutely freaking out, mainly because it was her own family that`s affected, and she texted my daughter stuff like &amp;quot;What if my mommy dies?&amp;quot;. She apparently knows about Covid deaths from her parents. My daughter`s best friend isn`t the type of child who can openly talk to her parents, since she doesn`t want to overburden her mom, and her dad often yells at her for crying and stuff like that (something I have talked to him about, but we aren`t really all that close). Anyway, it seems like my daughter was the only one she could share her anxiety with. I told my daughter that it`s great that she`s there for her best friend in such a tough situation, but that she should always step out if she feels like she can`t handle it anymore and doesn`t have to feel guilty about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter told me that she hates seeing her friend go through something so terrible. She also told me that knowing someone with the virus made it much more real to her, and that she can`t see it as something that`s far away anymore (obviously paraphrasing, she is only 9 and had a lot of trouble putting that into words).  I told her that I understand. I also told her that, after they`ve all recovered, she might be less scared because she sees it`s something that people can and do recover from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the conversation, I asked my kids to spend some time together, and my 11 year old son and her went to his room and played there. During that time, I called the best friend`s mom. I checked in with her about her condition. It was very obvious that she was sick, but she assured me it isn`t life-threatening and right now she`s just staying home trying to get through it. I told her about what had happened with her daughter, and she felt really bad and said she would try to calm her down as much as she can. I asked if  they needed anything, and she said they`re running low on groceries, since none of them have left the house since she first showed symptoms. I told my daughter and we picked up some food and basic necessities from the grocery store. At home, we cooked them some food, signed a little self-made &amp;quot;get well&amp;quot; card with a picture drawn by my daughter, and then we dropped all of that off at their front porch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we tried to keep everything as normal as possible, but we spent more time on our journal entry sharing time than we usually do (we have Corona journals and write a page every day, to share it with everyone else on the table during home-schooling). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of home-schooling, though, the schools open on Monday and I don`t know what to do. My 14 year old desperately wants to go to school and see her friends while the others absolutely do not, and I can`t exactly send my oldest if the others don`t consent, since everyone else in the family gets the virus if she gets it. Plus, I don`t think it`s safe to send them anyway, do you think I should just keep them all home? Home-schooling isn`t a problem for me per se, I just don`t want to throw my 14 year old`s needs under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my update. Could you give me some feedback on how I handled it and what I could do better if that happened again in the future? I was absolutely at a loss when it first happened.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't exactly know how long she's going to stay with us, but it could be a few weeks or months. I need advice on how to parent her. 

She isn't potty trained and she refuses to brush her teeth. I've tried everything to get to brush her teeth but all she does is cry and throws a tantrum. The potty is the same thing. I put her on it and she says she can't go, but then an hour later she'll go pee in her pull-up. So if someone could please give me advice with how to get her to do both of these things I would appreciate it.

My niece is also refusing to eat lots of things. I think she's used to junk food. She doesn't really want to eat anything else. How can I get her engaged in wanting to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner? 

I'm pretty sure my sister-in-law also treated my niece like a baby with no expectations or routine. My niece is used to getting her own way. So everything seems to be a fight with her. She thinks that crying will get her way, but I don't budge and she isn't used to that. I want to get down to her level and make her understand but it's difficult.

She is also scared of our 11 month old. I don't know why. He's very happy and he hardly cries. Is there any activites that they could do together to help form a bond? 

Finally, my niece always asks for her mom. I've explained to her that she's having a sleep over with auntie and uncle for a few days. This works for a little while, but usually around bedtime she starts to freak out and screams to go home and that she wants her mom. I feel terrible when she does this, but she has to stay with us.

&lt;p&gt;She isn&amp;#39;t potty trained and she refuses to brush her teeth. I&amp;#39;ve tried everything to get to brush her teeth but all she does is cry and throws a tantrum. The potty is the same thing. I put her on it and she says she can&amp;#39;t go, but then an hour later she&amp;#39;ll go pee in her pull-up. So if someone could please give me advice with how to get her to do both of these things I would appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My niece is also refusing to eat lots of things. I think she&amp;#39;s used to junk food. She doesn&amp;#39;t really want to eat anything else. How can I get her engaged in wanting to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure my sister-in-law also treated my niece like a baby with no expectations or routine. My niece is used to getting her own way. So everything seems to be a fight with her. She thinks that crying will get her way, but I don&amp;#39;t budge and she isn&amp;#39;t used to that. I want to get down to her level and make her understand but it&amp;#39;s difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also scared of our 11 month old. I don&amp;#39;t know why. He&amp;#39;s very happy and he hardly cries. Is there any activites that they could do together to help form a bond? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my niece always asks for her mom. I&amp;#39;ve explained to her that she&amp;#39;s having a sleep over with auntie and uncle for a few days. This works for a little while, but usually around bedtime she starts to freak out and screams to go home and that she wants her mom. I feel terrible when she does this, but she has to stay with us. How can I explain to her that she can&amp;#39;t go home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for any mistakes. Things have been pretty hectic over the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"Our son turned 3 last weekend. Leading up to the big day, we started taking about the Binky Fairy. The night before his birthday, we would gather up all of his binkies and put them outside of our front door, where the Binky Fairy would collect them during the night to give to other little kids. She would then leave a gift in exchange for all of his binkies. We thought this was genius.

Our son seemed to go along with it just fine, maybe with a little hesitation, but he was excited about what the Binky Fairy would bring for him. Prior to this momentous night, he slept with no fewer than three pacifiers; one in his mouth, and one in each hand. The night the Binky Fairy came, there didn't seem to be too much of a problem that he didn't have his usual three binkies, and the next morning, he was thrilled by his gift from the Binky Fairy.

The next few times he went to bed, for his naps and for the night, he asked about his binkies. We gently reminded him that the Binky Fairy took them to other little kids. He still seemed to accept this fine, but we've started noticing that it is getting harder and harder for him to get to sleep. He was such a sleeping champ before, and we don't mind him quietly playing and chatting to himself after going to bed. That's not really the problem. The problem is that he is now becoming a monster to get to bed. Before the binkies left, he was very agreeable to getting ready for bed. Now it's a crazy fight for both naps and bedtime, complete with chasing around a naked toddler as we try to get him into the bathroom for his last pee and for tooth brushing.

I think we've gotten into a vicious circle. He's not able to self-soothe as well without his pacifiers, so he doesn't fall asleep as quickly, which means that he's running more and more tired, which makes him even grumpier. Add in the fact that we also have a 9-month-old who hasn't figured out how to sleep later than 5am, and we've got an understandably cranky toddler. What then ends up happening is that our son's craziness at going down for his nap is now waking up his little sister, thus repeating the cycle of Baby waking up too early in the morning and creating an even crankier toddler combined with cranky parents.

So, dear Reddit, do you have any advice for two exacerbated quarantined parents? We're running toward the end of our rope, and we are seriously missing daycare.

So I've come to notice that it seems as though she talks constantly. I get to a point where I'm not sure what to do or how to respond.

,Parenting,"Hi parents. My partner and I are looking for advice on how you run your households. We’re hoping for insight on US-based public school scenarios. 

We are both full-time healthcare workers. We have two kids, one 3.5 years old and one 2 years old. Looking toward when they go to school (the oldest will be starting TK in about a year), we’re a little lost about how to handle things like school drop off, pick up, sports or extracurriculars, and so on. 

During non-covid times, they go to a daycare/preschool center from like 9 or 10am to 5 or 6pm. My partner and I work opposite shifts so whoever works late drops them off and whoever works early picks them up. It’s very leisurely and flexible. But that’s not how ‘real school’ works and we’re trying to think ahead. 

How do you parents do it? Does someone have to step down and be part time or stay at home? Or do you hire someone to be their drop off and pickup person, do homework with them, and fill those gaps you can’t attend to? How do you decide what to “make time” for by requesting time off work or arranging a different schedule? 

It seems so daunting to balance wanting to provide money and opportunities and financial security and wanting to provide time and physical presence.

,Parenting,"I feel like a moron posting this, knowing that no one can provide a definitive answer to such a vague issue, but here I am anyway.

I send my kid to a preschool that has 10 children. I am newish to the area and most of the other moms are longtime residents who are friends.  I'm not close with any of them but we are friendly enough—if we see each other at the grocery store or whatever, we say hello.

This week was my son's birthday.  Due to social distancing, I couldn't throw a party.  But I arranged for the local fire dept to come by with their truck to run the siren and say happy birthday. 

I emailed the entire parent group—they all literally live within a two mile radius, and invited them to join the mini parade.  I said they could park or hang out on our lawn and I would deliver favors curbside.  Not a single parent even replied to say they wouldn't make it.  

It's not like my kid knew the difference and he had a great day, but I feel worse than the kid who gets picked last in dodgeball.  

What's the etiquette for shit like this? Shouldn't at least one parent have said, ""Happy birthday—thanks but no thanks""? A piece of me feels like I need to self-examine and see how I could have possibly offended any of these people, but I find it hard to believe that I could be so off-putting when our interactions are limited to cordial hellos. 

Do any of you simply ignore invites without meaning ill will? Am I crazy? Let's say I am the asshole: do you normally prohibit your kids from attending parties if you feel sort of meh (or worse) about the birthday child's parent?

,Parenting,"Background because our life is crazy:

My husband and I are out of work. Me due to this COVID mess and my husband due to health reasons. My husband does not get SSI, but we are in the process of applying again (his first time was denied). We have a 14 year old and a 5 year old. Both have Autism. Our youngest has a developmental delay as well. He is a bright boy, but lives firmly in the concrete world and has trouble with comprehension of abstract things. We've been trying to connect more with each other (husband &amp; wife) because taking care of two disabled boys is all consuming. Before this happened we were already on edge. We have no family that will take the boys overnight. We have no friends that will. We do not qualify for respite care. We cannot afford a babysitter. We're on our own out in this world. Also, we don't have a working car so we can't take him for a drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week our 5 year old decided he was done sleeping forever. He had a bad dream and was never sleeping again. We tried to talk more about dreams to him, but the concept is too abstract for him to understand. He believes that the things are really happening. We tried reading social stories and watching shows with dream sequences. I tried explaining that dreams are like ""silly movies that your brain makes up"". He then wanted to know where Netflix was in his dreams. After some back and forth he gave up and decided that we were not telling the truth. He thinks they are real and wants 100% guarantee that they will stop or he's not sleeping again.

We've tried saying that his giant stuffed Yoshi will 'eat the bad dreams', but he has trouble with imagination and responded with ""Yoshi isn't real"".

We tried reading about dream catchers and making our own. Didn't soothe him.

We also are not allowed to sleep, as he doesn't want to be alone. He fears that he could suddenly fall asleep and have dreams. It is our job to stop his dreams from happening. He is most concerned about ""being alone in his dreams.""He is angry at us for not following him into his dreams and helping him. He has had many dreams but the following dreams are ones that have upset him greatly:

* Our dog was throwing pickles in his shoes and making a mess.
* He was flying and couldn't land
* He was being chased by a lava monster
* Spiders were on the wall dancing.

Here is how things are going now:

We do our nighttime routine. He falls asleep at 8pm, wakes up at 11pm and then every hour after that for 20-30 minutes until 6am. He won't sleep during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried:

* Weighted Blanket
* Stretchy Sheets
* Noise Machine
* Night Light
* Eliminating Screen Time
* Extra Walks
* Deep Breathing Exercises
* Social Stories
* Positive Reinforcement
* Sticker Chart
* Sleeping in a preferred place
* Allowing him to just be awake in our room so we can sleep
* Asking the school for help. (They didn't/haven't gotten back to me. I don't know what they can do though)
* Asked his Pedi. They brushed me off, saying it was a phase. He then suggested Melatonin. That gave him freakier dreams (Spiders Dancing) and make things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing works. Now we're on shifts so one of us can sleep while the other can handle him. He basically has a meltdown every time he wakes up and we go through the same 5-6 questions while he's screaming, throwing things and hyperventilating.

""Why was I asleep? I hate sleep!""

""Why did you let me sleep? ""

""Why do I have to be all alone \[in my dreams\]?""

""When is it morning?""

&amp;#x200B;

It's torture for him and it's torture for us. This can **not** go on. I'm 100% sure he'd break down the door if I tried to just lock the door and sleep. That's not safe anyway so it's not even an option. The one good thing is that our teenager sleeps like the dead and doesn't wake up for anything, so he has not been affected. I don't know why younger son 'allows' older son to sleep or what is thought process is. Frankly I'm not about to ask becasue that will start problems.

I have two step children in their teens. When they're here, there's a bit of discourse. They refuse to clean up after themselves (I don't mandate they clean up after adults), will fight me on bedtime when their father is asleep, take zero direction from me, and view me as the live-in maid/nurse/teacher. I'm used to that. 

What I can't get used to is the food situation. They will eat from the time they wake until they sleep, and if you're not the first to get food, you're probably not eating at planned meal times. If I get to dinner late and head to the fridge, they're right there, grabbing the food before I do and making sure there's either very little or nothing left. For the past two years, I've been having to deal with the reality that when they're here, popcorn is my one meal a day. That's also gone to hell, because they've started attacking that, too. 

I've discussed it with their father at length, and have spoken to them about it, too (""Don't go for seconds or fifths until everyone has eaten""), to no avail. He excuses their behavior with ""It's just genetics"" and when they're called out on anything, it's ""I forgot"". When I finally give up and just retire to the bedroom for the evening in defeat - no screaming, no fits, no outbursts - I get glared at or talked to later for ""being ridiculous"" because I regularly give up.

I love my kids. I’d lay down my life for them. But my youngest daughter is my favorite, and it’s been that way for a long time. I keep telling myself one of these days that will change. It hasn’t. We just click. 

When I had my son, I had absolutely horrid PPD and I didn’t bond with him until he was about 4 months old, once I got on a good anti depressant. He’s so stinking smart. From age 2 he was playing chess, doing math in his head, grasping concepts like gravity and the cosmos. He’s a good kid. The kind of kid who stands up to bullies and invites the kids no one likes to his birthday party because “they deserve to have fun like everyone else”. He’s always been so independent and it’s great but he’s not a cuddler or a hugger or one to even reply when I say “I love you”. And I tell him how much I love him all the time and it stings that he rolls his eyes or tells me “maybe I love you too” laughing. He pushes away when I try to show affection and has since the first grade when he rolled his eyes at school drop off and said “don’t be so obnoxious, mom”. 

My other daughter isn’t mine from birth, I met her when she was 9. I love her. She’s amazing, super smart, great student, fun loving, and is a great teenager. She’s talented at writing and is In band. She is a good listener and loves playing video games with me.

My youngest daughter is my favorite though. We bonded instantly. She was a hard baby. Never slept through the dang night like her brother. She’s a level 9000 clinger and I often wish for space, but she’s also so sweet. She’s shy, and quiet, and caring, she’s the kid that shares he coveted French fries at lunch with kids who can’t afford school lunch. I don’t know, we just think alike. She’s into art and dolls and makeup. I was a total Tomboy as a kid so that can’t be it. It’s hard to say, our minds just work the same? She can look at me and know what I’m thinking. She hugs me when she thinks I’m sad. She’s an empathetic person, and I am too.

,Parenting,"So I was wondering about methods to manage screentime for my Son (9) across all the different devices he might use.
 
The devices are:
- PC
- iPad
- Android Phone
- Android Tablet
- Nintendo Switch
- TV

Not all of them are his mind you but over time he uses almost all devices at least for a bit. 

Since I'm pretty tech savvy myself, my first approach was obviously to use the devices own possibility to manage screentime. And there are indeed some that handle that very well. But the big drawback is, if for example he gets an hour screentime on a weekday, and I set the devices to an hour, naturally he could just play switch for an hour, then use the iPad for an hour and so on. Also I don't want to limit him to one device per day because that would just suck.

So now I was thinking about printing some kind of list where he himself writes down the time he starts using a device as well as the time he puts it away, thus tracking his screentime himself.
Sure, that sounds convoluted, but the hassle is on his side, so I don't really mind ;). 

So yeah, that's my idea. And now I hope to hear what you guys do to manage your kids screentime.

oh and I'm explicitly not asking about how long the screentime should be or what devices are ok for a child to use. Also just keeping track by just keeping an eye on him doesn't work because with all the working from home and having also a 3 year old at home all the time that's just not doable.

,Parenting,"Disclaimer: When I feel angry or frustrated or that I dislike her I STEP AWAY. None of this is her fault. I just don't know how to manage these feelings.

My daughter is 3. My husband and I are in our mid 30s and stable in finances and our relationship. The current virus situation isn't helping anything but my feelings turned to the way they are now before this. 

I work part time in healthcare so I still work my normal hours, my husband is working from home. 

The bottom line is while everyone is gushing about the toddler years and how you can start to see their personality shine, I'm really starting to dislike my child. IDK what's wrong with me. I can't seem to reframe my thinking either.

She's always a mess. Always. She has long hair she refuses to let us cut which is always in her face and then she cries. Put a headband on her and then she cries. She always has food on her face, something she got into on her clothes, she bites her nails which we can't get her to stop (or she cries), there's always spit all over her hands. 

Her speech is normal for her age but I can't deal with it. I can't understand her. Then she gets frustrated and she cries. She's an EXTREMELY picky eater and even when I give up and just let her eat what she wants, mealtimes end in tears. 

She clings all. the. time. If I tell her ""Mommy's busy, we can play later"" she cries. If I assert a kind but firm boundary and move her to her room to play alone until I'm free, she cries. She's always grabbing me and clinging to me and hugging on me and usually crying.

If I let her pick what she wants to wear she decides she hates it and cries. If I choose, she cries. 

If I let her play with what she wants and it doesn't go or turn out exactly the way she wants, she cries. If I choose an activity she cries. If we take her where she asks to go (park, zoo, store, etc) something invariably goes wrong and she cries. If we don't, she cries. 

Mealtimes, bedtimes, playtimes, basically any time and days that end in Y are a never ending stream of crying. Then she starts babbling AND crying and *I can't understand her* and she KEEPS crying.

This child is never not crying. I don't even want to look at her stupid, blotchy, tear stained, frazzled haired face anymore and she used to be the cuddliest, most beautiful baby. I hate that I hate the sight of my own child but *all she does is cry*. That's literally ALL she does.

We've taken her in for almost every medical test imaginable. She's healthy. We've taken her to 3 different child and family therapists. Of course she didn't cry there. But in the car? Instant waterworks. 

The general professional consensus is that she's just a sensitive child and she'll learn emotional regulation, we need to hold reasonable boundaries and she'll grow out of it.

But I've given serious thought to leaving my husband so I don't have to deal with this shrieking little pest anymore and THIS IS MY CHILD. Shouldn't I be full of love for her even of she's difficult right now?

&lt;p&gt;This child is never not crying. I don&amp;#39;t even want to look at her stupid, blotchy, tear stained, frazzled haired face anymore and she used to be the cuddliest, most beautiful baby. I hate that I hate the sight of my own child but &lt;em&gt;all she does is cry&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;#39;s literally ALL she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve taken her in for almost every medical test imaginable. She&amp;#39;s healthy. We&amp;#39;ve taken her to 3 different child and family therapists. Of course she didn&amp;#39;t cry there. But in the car? Instant waterworks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general professional consensus is that she&amp;#39;s just a sensitive child and she&amp;#39;ll learn emotional regulation, we need to hold reasonable boundaries and she&amp;#39;ll grow out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve given serious thought to leaving my husband so I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with this shrieking little pest anymore and THIS IS MY CHILD. Shouldn&amp;#39;t I be full of love for her even of she&amp;#39;s difficult right now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am at the end of my rope. I have nothing left. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

I showed up in a facemask, stood 6ft back after ringing the current tenant&amp;#39;s doorbell.  There was 2 boys that answered the door roughly around 8-12 years old. The mom came to the door seemingly annoyed, I stated I changed my address but Amazon used an old/ default address, sorry for the hassle, blah blah blah.  One of her sons handed me The backpack. No box or extra packaging. Just the backpack opened. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything other than Thank you and I left. I&amp;#39;m in my car and there is toys in the backpack. Obviously the boys were playing with it. Annoyed and a little pissed off that my package arrived just a few hours earlier and they opened what I bought and allowed her kids to play with it. BTW, I&amp;#39;d did a change of address upon moving. Thanks for listening.

I constantly day dream about leaving my family just so I can have more freedom and time for myself. I don't mean leave forever, but to live by myself and having the kids every other week. Even though this means I still will be responsible for the kids 50% of the time, it still feels like more freedom than I have now.

I never really wanted child #2. I told my wife that I didn't feel like I had the energy for one child, yet alone two. But she kind of persuaded me to get another anyway.

As much as I would like to let him just relax after work, I also feel emotionally and physically exhausted by the time he gets home and would like nothing more than to just nap. Sometimes if we’re lucky the baby will nap with us, but that’s rare and most times we just go off on who needs it the most.

,Parenting,"My wife and I separated when she was only two months old. The pregnancy ended up exposing a lot of bad in our relationship, so on and so forth...

Fast forward 10 months, we are in a custody battle which I am slowly but surely winning, which is absolutely wonderful, but we recently had an increase in time that she spends with me and things have started to change for the worst. 

Allow me to preface this by saying that I love her more than anything in the world, and I would do anything for her, so this feels horrible to say.

We have a lot of fun playing together, she's well fed and is developmentally fine. I started to get her for two overnights a week about two months ago and in the last week or so things have gone south for reasons that I don't understand.

She now will not play alone for any longer than two minutes before she starts whining. That whining, if not catered to within a few more minutes will turn into visceral screaming as though she is being decapitated with a butter knife.  Beyond not playing alone, if I don't pick her up constantly she will do the same thing.  But even picking her up isn't enough as she will often crawl all over me crying.  I need time alone sometimes, time to go to the bathroom, or do some work.

Her doctor offered that I should let her cry it out, expressing that, much like a dog, if you continue to give in, you'll continue to support this behavior and that sometimes the best thing to do is to just let her understand intermittently that she is safe, but to otherwise not comply with her request so long as she's in this state.

The problem is, she can cry for a really long time. I mean, I have no idea how she doesn't pass out at some point.  My ex says that she doesn't experience this at all, which makes me feel like I'm the one that has messed up, giving in too frequently.

It really bothers me, forcing me to experience a range of emotions from sadness and abject failure to rage (always electing to walk away). I just want her to be happy.

Has anyone had success with crying it out?  Is she actually old enough to understand that she can behave differently between my ex and I?  What else can I do?",t2_h2ymy,False,,0,False,Extremely Clingy 1yr (F),"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Behaviour'}]",r/Parenting,False,6,behaviour,0,False,t3_gbz628,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Behaviour,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1588417327.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Parenting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife and I separated when she was only two months old. The pregnancy ended up exposing a lot of bad in our relationship, so on and so forth...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 10 months, we are in a custody battle which I am slowly but surely winning, which is absolutely wonderful, but we recently had an increase in time that she spends with me and things have started to change for the worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to preface this by saying that I love her more than anything in the world, and I would do anything for her, so this feels horrible to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of fun playing together, she&amp;#39;s well fed and is developmentally fine. I started to get her for two overnights a week about two months ago and in the last week or so things have gone south for reasons that I don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She now will not play alone for any longer than two minutes before she starts whining. That whining, if not catered to within a few more minutes will turn into visceral screaming as though she is being decapitated with a butter knife.  Beyond not playing alone, if I don&amp;#39;t pick her up constantly she will do the same thing.  But even picking her up isn&amp;#39;t enough as she will often crawl all over me crying.  I need time alone sometimes, time to go to the bathroom, or do some work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her doctor offered that I should let her cry it out, expressing that, much like a dog, if you continue to give in, you&amp;#39;ll continue to support this behavior and that sometimes the best thing to do is to just let her understand intermittently that she is safe, but to otherwise not comply with her request so long as she&amp;#39;s in this state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, she can cry for a really long time. I mean, I have no idea how she doesn&amp;#39;t pass out at some point.  My ex says that she doesn&amp;#39;t experience this at all, which makes me feel like I&amp;#39;m the one that has messed up, giving in too frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really bothers me, forcing me to experience a range of emotions from sadness and abject failure to rage (always electing to walk away). I just want her to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had success with crying it out?  Is she actually old enough to understand that she can behave differently between my ex and I?  What else can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

,Parenting,"I know many, many children are going through a lot right now, and we have followed recommendations to try and be comforting, etc. but it is really becoming a huge problem every night (edit: *since lockdown*) where our daughter will SHRIEK that she's hungry, delay bedtime for HOURS, or wakes up after a few hours and decides she's up for the day (essentially treating bedtimes as naps). It is pretty much nightly, and my husband and I are exhausted. On top of this, I'm very pregnant and very tired.

We have tried different methods including ignoring the screaming, explaining to her (not just at bedtime), laying with her, not laying with her, telling her she won't get to do X if she doesn't rest, telling her she doesn't have to sleep but can play or read quietly in her room, etc. Nothing is working.

One of the big issues is she is constantly saying she is hungry, no matter how much she has eaten - and she eats a LOT, and we've been doing a bedtime snack before her usual milk before bed. We tried not feeding her or giving her milk, we tried giving her a little bit, and I've tried giving her ice chips instead of food, but she will still scream and bawl that she's hungry. Last night she would not sleep until she had 2 full cups of milk. She slept around 11pm. She woke up at 6am, and tonight again it's 9:30 and we started her ""calm down""/pre-bedtime routine at 7:30pm.

She went for a run today, and in the evening we did bubbles and physical activity at home to help her burn energy. She had a big dinner of burger, fries, chocolate milk which finished around 6:30, I think. At 8:05pm she had a bedtime snack of half a fruit crisp, some cashews, and peppermint tea. Then she had a full cup of warm milk. We read a story, brushed her teeth, brought her to bed and once she gets in bed she becomes wild and the insistence of hunger starts again.

I don't want her to get cavities. We repeatedly tell her to eat as much as she can before bed because after brushing her teeth it's bad to eat. She agrees and says she doesn't want cavities. But she will literally stay up and battle us once it's actually bedtime. On top of that, she stops listening. She asked me for a story, and I agreed but only if she laid down. She didn't lay down and just kept repeating she wants a story. So I kept repeating, sure I will read you the story when you lay down. Then she started screaming at me. So I told her during a non-screaming moment if she kept screaming, I would leave, but I'm happy to read a story if she lays down. She continued the screaming, so I left the room.

Then after a few minutes she started crying and screaming saying she was scared and hungry.  My husband and I were like - do we just do this every night because of what's going on? We've spoken to social workers/therapists who are saying to pretty much do what the kids want but it's becoming very exhausting to do it for hours after her bedtime, and the middle of the night, and then having her wake up early.

Our daughter didn't do anything near this before lockdown. She did have issues before bedtime but nothing on this level. She slept by herself and didn't wake up at night except to pee.  Now, she needs someone there, needs milk, etc. There was maybe a week (2 weeks ago?) that her sleep looked like it was getting back to normal then it went back to this crap.

Sorry for the long post.

**Edit:** I think she's asleep now (\~10pm) after the milk and my husband laying with her. This is an upgrade from last night where that was not enough.

**Tl;dr:** 3yo has been a MESS with sleep since lockdown, will literally stay up and demand milk once or twice, and sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night for the day.

Some backstory to explain the situation and give perspective:

-My 14yr old (grade 9) son failed 2 classes last semester for not doing the work.

-This semester he almost failed a 3rd class for the same reason, but the teacher actually called me this time, gave me all the work and gave my son the opportunity to do the work with docked marks for lateness.

-he has mild autism but no learning disorders and is average intellectually (so no real issues preventing him from doing the work or making the effort other than task management)

-during this period of at-home-learning, his teachers assign work on Monday, it's due on Friday. I've been using a task manager to break up the assignments into 1hour-ish increments per class (total 3-4 hours a day of class) 

-I have FOUR TIMES shown him how to take notes, how to write, how to edit, how to format a paper.

-i have been breaking down each step and given it in his daily task manager, so it's very clear what needs to be done. Those tasks also have subtasks should any further break down be needed.

-i have been editing for him! Writing notes on Google docs with instructions and corrections and having him do the corrections.

The issue:

This child doesn't put effort into anything 😩
More importantly, With the tall management and help with editing, and instruction on how to do things I end up putting as much time into the assignments as him!  With no results in the end!

This week, even AFTER braking down every minute step of a glacier research paper for him, he didn't manage to get it done to an acceptable level. (This is not the first time for this particular class. And it's the same from one of his previous failed classes.)

It's due in 90 minutes. He has nothing that will garner marks to hand in. 

Because rather than researching, he never once read the instructions and instead complained about how unfair having to write a report is. ( it's totally fair and who cares if it's fair??!!)

I told him, that's it! I'm done, I'm not helping you anymore with this assignment. You won't listen, you're talking over me, denying doing anything wrong, refusing to put the effort in, shouting at me, rolling your eyes. 
I'm not helping anymore and you'll have to hand in what you have because you had plenty of time and help to complete it with good results.

So the question: 

Am I wrong for refusing to help anymore with less than 2 hrs to go?
I feel like he deserves a bad mark, he earned it! He should accept the consequences of his bad choices!

But I also think, it's my responsibility as his mom to ensure he gets good grades.

,Parenting,"My daughter is 5 and will be 6 in November. She is my oldest child and I also have a son who will be 4 next month and I am 7 months pregnant with our last child. The problem I am having is it seems like my daughter never left the terrible 2 stage. She is my oldest so I kept saying “oh this must be a phase” but it never went away and I only recently thought that maybe it won’t go away because my 3yo has turned into a mostly respectful child (he makes mistakes occasionally but almost always apologizes and is better for the rest of the day). 

For example, this morning she puts on a shirt out of the dirty hamper that has food smashed into it in multiple places. I tell her that she has to pick something else to wear today because it is dirty. She then starts yelling no at me and that she’s wearing it anyways. She ended up going to time out after this being continuous ( 5 minutes, we do 1 minute per year of age). She comes out of timeout and we have a heart to heart talk about why, etc and she goes to sit down. Then she immediately takes something from her brother to which he starts crying and I ask her to give it back. She starts yelling no at me again and I go to take it from her and she’s pushing and kicking and thrashing. She goes back into time out for 5 minutes. Then while she’s in timeout she starts screaming at her brother that “I get X today and you don’t HAHAHA”. 

Basically this is how my life is 24/7 and it’s starting to affect my sons behavior as well (he mimics her at times and does the same behavior back to her). It’s to the point where she still will hurt her brother and I (hitting on purpose or even just thrashing about when she doesn’t get what she wants). Her school said she is the best behaved child there in her class which honestly completely shocks me. Even asking her to pick up her toys in the living room I basically have to hold her hand and guide her to do it or she won’t. I’ve also caught her telling her brother in his ear to do bad things so he will get into trouble. We have tried multiple discipline strategies, I’ve tried natural consequences, taking things away, time outs, my husband wanted to try spanking which I didn’t really want to but even that didn’t work. So we’ve just resorted to time outs and just trying to talk to her and make her understand why there are rules or why I ask her to do something. 

I also have tried things like positive reinforcement, and I make a conscious effort to give her extra time and attention because I’ve thought well maybe I’m just not giving her the positive attention she needs but it’s not helping either. 

I don’t know if this helps but we have been told she’s gifted. She draws incredibly well (like can draw Minnie Mouse and you will immediately know it’s Minnie Mouse) and is already doing addition and subtraction and has always done well with numbers. 

As soon as this virus is through I have a consultation on standby with her pediatrician but I was just curious if anyone else has gone through this and possibly has any tips?

She is my oldest so I kept saying “oh this must be a phase” but it never went away and I only recently thought that maybe it won’t go away because my 3yo has turned into a mostly respectful child (he makes mistakes occasionally but almost always apologizes and is better for the rest of the day). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this morning she puts on a shirt out of the dirty hamper that has food smashed into it in multiple places. I tell her that she has to pick something else to wear today because it is dirty. She then starts yelling no at me and that she’s wearing it anyways. She ended up going to time out after this being continuous ( 5 minutes, we do 1 minute per year of age). She comes out of timeout and we have a heart to heart talk about why, etc and she goes to sit down. Then she immediately takes something from her brother to which he starts crying and I ask her to give it back. She starts yelling no at me again and I go to take it from her and she’s pushing and kicking and thrashing. She goes back into time out for 5 minutes. Then while she’s in timeout she starts screaming at her brother that “I get X today and you don’t HAHAHA”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically this is how my life is 24/7 and it’s starting to affect my sons behavior as well (he mimics her at times and does the same behavior back to her). It’s to the point where she still will hurt her brother and I (hitting on purpose or even just thrashing about when she doesn’t get what she wants). Her school said she is the best behaved child there in her class which honestly completely shocks me. Even asking her to pick up her toys in the living room I basically have to hold her hand and guide her to do it or she won’t. I’ve also caught her telling her brother in his ear to do bad things so he will get into trouble. We have tried multiple discipline strategies, I’ve tried natural consequences, taking things away, time outs, my husband wanted to try spanking which I didn’t really want to but even that didn’t work. So we’ve just resorted to time outs and just trying to talk to her and make her understand why there are rules or why I ask her to do something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have tried things like positive reinforcement, and I make a conscious effort to give her extra time and attention because I’ve thought well maybe I’m just not giving her the positive attention she needs but it’s not helping either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this helps but we have been told she’s gifted. She draws incredibly well (like can draw Minnie Mouse and you will immediately know it’s Minnie Mouse) and is already doing addition and subtraction and has always done well with numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as this virus is through I have a consultation on standby with her pediatrician but I was just curious if anyone else has gone through this and possibly has any tips? I love her so much and I just want to have the best relationship with her now so she feels supported and loved and won’t have any problems as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
