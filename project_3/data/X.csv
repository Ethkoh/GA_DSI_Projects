"I get it, you're probably tired of hearing from me.😶 I hadn't planned to do a new sticky this week and was going to let the other one naturally bump out of place as the new automated schedule started rolling in. 

💓It just obvious from the mod queue that some of you are really down, really upset, really frustrated, and really struggling.💔

📞📱✍If you can reach out to someone in your personal life - please do. This is a unique situation that is kind of impacting everyone in the world at the same time. It's very different than other types of disasters that tend to be localized to a specific geographic region. I think anyone you called could commiserate a little. I'm in the southern U.S. and talked to friends in Scotland, New Zealand, and Germany today...we just vented a little to each other. It wasn't a cure, but it helped.

Wondering who your mods are? [Click here to meet the mod team!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/wiki/meetmodteam)"
"My daughter (10) came to me recently and told me she wants a teacup dog. As she is showing me pictures of them on her laptop, she says, ""Look at how cute they are! They're only $750-$2000!""

I told her we just aren't in a good position to get a dog right now (due to various monetary and living situation issues) and there is NO WAY we are getting a dog that costs that much.  I told her there are many dogs out there in need of good homes.  So when it is time to get a dog, I'd like to get a dog from the Humane Society or from a rescue.  She walked away in silent protest.

As I walked past her a few minutes later, I saw half a tear in her eye.  She must have done a google search of rescued dogs because on the laptop were pictures of abused dogs.  She looked up at me and said she changed her mind and now wants a rescue dog.  I was happy she changed her mind but I felt bad that I introduced her to that part of humanity."
"Our Daughter is 6 years old, and has never been very affectionate. We’ve accepted this as best as we can and understand it’s just in her nature to not be very cuddly or forthcoming with affectionate words. She’s a very happy child and is engaging, astute and easygoing, she’s simply not a snuggly type of person. We tell her we love her every day and have switched up our sayings to things like “I really like your personality” and “I care about you so much” Twice in the last 3 days my daughter has told me she loves me. It fills me up with a lot of emotion and I just wanted to share. I know she loves us, it just really helps to hear it.  I know I might not hear it for many more months but it keeps me going. Anyone else have a child that is reluctant to speak the words?"
My 4 year old constantly is asking about a merman and cowboy toy. I have no idea what he is talking about or where to even look. Does anyone possibly know what he is talking about.
"I was playing a song on my guitar as I tend too do from time to time. This one is special too me however as it is mine and was my late ex's favorite song. So I'm playing it in the living room and my daughter walks up and tells me it sounds good and if I can show her how to play it. So I do my best. It took me 2 weeks to learn too play it really well, it took her 50 minutes. I had a proud dad moment then felt depressed as my late ex also had a knack for being able to learn things quickly. I miss her so much but am also reminded of how much she loved me by what she left me."
"I was giving my 5 month old tiny terrorist (TT) a bath which started out as any normal bath starts. My girl loves the water and enjoys splashing all around. The giggles and cute noises that come from her are just adorable and I really enjoy this time and seeing her so happy. 

Suddenly her face and demenor change. I'm not sure why until I see some floaties. A few little pieces of poop, a warning I would come to find out. I lift my daughter out, clear the bath super quick with a good wipe down just to be sure, fill it back up and off we go. TT's face starts the smiles and enjoyment we had seen previously and I think everything's good. 

Now a red face of anger appears and I realize were not out of the woods. I life up my daughter and there I see it. A large full green log starts falling out of my once sweet daughter. Her giggles soon turn to screams as my look of amazement turns to gags and dry heaving. Screams for help bellow through the house as my wife runs in the room to see what's wrong. What I thought was back up and an ally turns into my wife standing cross legged in the door way laughing and telling me to stop or she's gonna pee herself. 

I have read multiple parenting books, keep up on parenting blogs and social media accounts. Not one of them prepared me for this situation."
"My son's dad has a gf that he has been with for about 4.5 years now- so since my son was 3.

Since the beginning, she's always been rude and controlling to my son.

When my son was younger, he used to be very sad about it and cry about it when he came home. Now that he is older, he just  has a lot of anger covering that sadness.

My son's dad knows this is true but he's super passive/passive aggressive and also can't be alone, so he has stayed with her. Now she is pregnant so that complicates things even more.  


Some of the situations are really just weird things, like petty little things and harassing him about wearing specific clothes she buys him... forcing him to eat things he doesn't want to, not letting him eat or drink except certain times (his dad and I are fine with pretty free range behaviors as long as it's healthy choices), she argues with him consistently and uses big words he says he doesn't understand, she speaks to him sarcastically, and she accuses him of things and calls him a liar. I feel like she is a bully. 

This situation is getting worse and my son is starting to develop behavioral issues and stress about going there. He's developed a weird fear about me dying because he doesn't want to be left with them. He also doesn't want to be left alone with her if my son's dad goes to work or has to run errands. We are 50/50 custody. I don't want my son to be developing weird complexes because of this. The stress of this is affecting me, too. If I try to get more time, I will need child support. I also know that my son's dad won't give up more time with him. Going through the legal system and this fight again sounds like hell on earth. 

I haven't intervened or spoken to her-- I've only spoken to my son's dad. But now, I'm going to speak to her.

I just don't know what to do about this situation. I feel bad that it's gotten this bad but for some dumb reason,  I just trusted my son's dad to handle it like an adult.

Any suggestions?"
"So, my 6yo boy is a single child. Admittedly, he's a bit of a sore loser and we're working on it. We play board games and I have to correct him when I catch him trying to cheat or change the rules. OTOH I do catch myself going easy on him, especially when he's had a really bad string of luck with the dice or something. So he's got this video game he likes to play, except he'll play against himself. He can set the game to multiplayer but instead of playing against the computer, he'll play against himself so he controls every aspect of the gameplay. Sometimes he even does this in 4-player. Sometimes he wants me to play with him, except then he'll insist on dictating all of my turns as well. So he's not really letting me play, you know? I told him I won't play with him again if I can't choose my own moves and my own way to play. Just wondering if anyone else has this problem and what you do about a sore loser."
"My kiddo (C) likes a lot of things that are traditionally ‘for boys’, like video games and LEGO, but he also enjoys some things that aren’t traditionally masculine. He loves having his hair long, he listens to the Jonas Brothers, he really likes pink and purple. He’s only eleven and I don’t ever want him to feel ashamed of what he likes, but I come from a family where traditional masculinity is pretty valued. My dad sometimes tells him that his long hair makes him look like a girl (it doesn’t), and I know that he gets teased by some other kids. His sibling tells him that ‘boys shouldn’t cry’ and ‘boys should be tough’.


I love my kiddo, and I love that he’s interested in so many things. I don’t ever want him to feel embarrassed about liking something that isn’t ‘boyish’. Now that he’s getting older, he’s getting some more messages from the media about what being a ‘man’ really is. Does anyone have any similar problems, or any advice about how to impress upon him that he can like whatever he likes, and that he should never be ashamed of that? I’m a little lost."
"My kids are going through a horror phase, and want to watch a scary movie, so I am looking for films they can watch that are also appropriate for 10yr olds.   I am struggling as most of the classics are of course far too adult!   My problem is when I google around the only recommendations I am finding for kids are cotton-wool ""horror"" movies like Monsters Inc and Hotel Transylvania based on official ratings - these are great movies, but they aren't scary.  These are kids that regularly watch MCU, DC, Star Wars etc. so are used to on screen intensity and even Ghostbusters they liked but didn't have them spooked.   My common sense rules are no gore, no nudity, minimal bad language.  I am not trying to traumatise the kids of course but there must be a middle ground between young kids spooky films and full on adult horror?   I know it's not a scary movie but Lord of the Rings was getting close to what i'm after as it;s pretty dark at times.  I also thought of original 1922 Nosferatu perhaps.    Any other recommendations?"
"I am divorced and remarried. My daughter (12) from my first marriage is quite spoiled and refuses to talk to me or visit me unless I take her on a vacation, to a hotel, buy her lots of things. We used to go to the movies and do a lot of activities during my time but her tastes have gotten very expensive and I can't give her what she wants for her to agree to see me. 

She won't talk to me via text or FaceTime because I went on a trip without her. This was a budget trip to see friends, not an expensive vacation. My friends invited my wife and I, not my daughter. 

Now that she is older she constantly tells me she is too busy to talk to me or see me. She's 12 so she is not in control of her own social life, however she is not so small that I could simply go over and take her. She lives about 2 hours away so I would need to coordinate with either her or her mom but they are both ignoring me. 

There isn't much I can do from a legal side right now, and my custody schedule is minimal due to me being active duty. Until recently I always got more time than I was supposed to have per the agreement. 

I just want my daughter to talk to me but it seems like she wants me to buy her love. Her mom remarried and had another kid and she did not have an adjustment problem to that. She has only met her little sister (baby with new wife) once and seemed to love her and want to be involved, but as soon as she went home she cut me off."
"I did a few searches on r/parenting and the last good thread on this topic was one month ago. Is everyone still paying for daycare services due to the fear of losing a spot? Are you paying half or non at all? In our state, it could be August or September before daycare opens for non-essential workers."
"My son is 5 months old, and has a moderate tongue tie. It was noticed before we even left the hospital and they told me he’d likely need it clipped to successfully breastfeed. I waited for problems but they never arrived! I had no pain when nursing him, he gained weight like a champ and we’re still going strong exclusively breastfeeding. I’ve been told by a few nurses and doctors in a very nonchalant way that they should just snip it even if he’s not having any feeding issues to prevent speech problems down the line. Can anyone vouch with personal experience here who did not get a tie clipped? Is it a big deal to clip later if he DOES develop speech problems? It seems unnecessary and a bit of a “trendy” problem to have, I know dozens of parents who had the tiniest ties clipped just because their doc suggested it."
"Both of my daughters (6y &amp; 2y) wake up every morning at 6am, no matter what time they go to sleep. I’ve tried adjusting their bedtimes to a little later, but nope! They still wake up at 6am but are crabby. My 6yo goes to bed a little bit later than the 2yo. Is there something I can do to try to get them to sleep in for a bit longer?"
"Hi. I am largely following recommendations from the P.E.T. book; explain to the child how their behaviour impacts me, and work on finding a solution together. 

I have a case at hand though, where I find this approach doesn't seem to help. My son is 8yrs old and a fan of Minecraft. We have screen time rules at home that says kids can't play video games until after breakfast + school + homework. Twice now, I've caught my son sneaking to his tablet and playing Minecraft. Both occasions I kept calm and told him that this is making me feel sad because he's not sticking to the agreement we made together. Both cases we found a different solution (i.e. we placed the tablet in a shared drawer instead of his room, we installed a time tracking app etc) and he promised not to repeat. 

  
Today I caught him do this again. Obviously he's addicted to the game, and can't control himself. More worryingly it doesn't seem to register with him that this makes me sad and unhappy. 

Wondering what my next step could be. Any tips?"
"I was sitting on the couch and bright light flooded the room. I look up to see my two year old OUTSIDE on the porch. He had quickly figured out how to unlock and open the front glass door. It’s not child proofed because I can’t find *anything* that would work for this type of door. I hate to leave the main door closed all the time because it’s so dark, but that’s what we are having to do now. The natural light really helps with my depression, but it’s obviously not worth the risk of leaving the door open after this. Does ANYONE know of a baby proof option [for these types of glass doors](https://imgur.com/a/toRxrD6)-PLEASE..?"
"My (5m) ss has a bandai game thing that I got his dad to setup in his room as his first self controlled console ( sorta). The game is old arcade style games that he seems to love playing. But while the tv is in his room I rigged the setup to shut down after just one hour, and that is his allotted amount of gaming the each day. I am wondering however if the way I did this is wrong because we didn't trust him to only play for that one hour. In order to prevent extra game time I used a battery source that only has about one hour of life in it. His dad agrees with me on this setup but I don't want to seem like the evil stepmom for not trusting him to listen. Should I change it and trust him to listen or leave and let him earn it?"
"Help! We have three children, 2(m), 4(m), 7(f) and for the most part they are all great kids. However, our 4 year old is a screamer. All day long, it's a constant stream of ear drum shattering screeches. He screams when he's happy, when he's scared, when he's excited, when he's angry. It's become a major problem. 

Both my wife and I have developed minor PTSD because of it. When I arrive home I can already hear ear piercing wails from the driveway, inside I find my wife eating dinner quietly with a despondent glazed stare as the 4 year old screams his brains out. After hours of this we both tend to snap at him, ourselves screaming ""Quiet!!!"" or tossing him in his room for a few moments of silence. 

It's also a problem for our neighbors, an older couple on one side and a woman with cancer on the other side who has a very difficult time sleeping. The other day he was up at 7am, playing outside on the swing and screaming loud enough that I could hear him inside, on the other side of the house. The swing set it close enough to the neighbor's window that I'm sure he's woken them up more than once. He also screams when we go for walks in the neighborhood, when we're at the library, outside of his sister's school. Besides being embarrassing, I'm genuinely concerned that someone is going to call the police on us. Or worse, that something will happen to our active two years old who tends to run off while I'm dealing with the screaming.

This has been going on for years and we have tried everything: Hugs, weighted blanket, timeouts, eating ice chips, sticker chart, going for walks, empathetic listening, taking away tablet time, begging, pleading, sacrificial blood letting ceremonies (kidding). It's frustrating because his happy screams are the same as his angry screams, and anything can trigger it so there's no real way to remove the trigger. Some of today's triggers included: not having a piece of blue chalk, the 2 year old touched his doll's dress, he washed his hands with soap, got a dollop of whipped cream with his strawberries, his bicycle tipped over.

So... has anyone else had this experience and lived through it? Any advice?"
"I hope this is the right place to ask this, I feel so lost and just want to help my daughter. :( Not asking for med advice, as we have already gotten that, but more asking if you as the parent would just try help your child and not get there official diagnosis in her permanent record or if you would just go ahead and label so she could get assistance?)

My daughter has had some issues with schooling/learning since kindergarten(a five minute assignment can take her up to an hour because she gets distracted, starts thinking of other stuff, forgets to read all the instructions, etc) but has been at or above grade level on the work she does. We thought this was just a kid thing that she would grow out of but it has worsened with time and started to affect her schooling (becoming sad at missing out on class activities because she had to finish work, etc) We got her tested for ADD- doctor said that she meets the diagnosis for an ADD-inattentive diagnosis BUT he recommended that I just talk to the next teacher at the beginning of the year and see if they could work with my daughter rather than have an official diagnosis of ADD and if the teacher wouldn’t work with her then they could put the diagnosis in as official and create a 504 plan. He said that some view it as a stigma and “you don’t want it popping up on the top of her chart year after year for the teachers.” 

MY QUESTION- I have no experience with any of this and just learned was a 504 plan was two weeks ago. I don’t want her to face stigma or be seen as a nuisance or whatever to teachers. (Btw, I’m not even sure what sort of stigma she might face but would never want her to feel badly about herself or her performance in school) Would you make it official to have a 504 plan in place for your child in this situation? Or would you just wait and play it by ear, discussing it with the next teacher at the beginning of the year as the doctor suggested?

I know this was really long. For those who read it, I appreciate it 💕"
"So I want to start this by saying I have no problems with any sexualities and how people or my chidlren identify themselves.

About a month ago.. our 11 year old started identifying as a bi-sexual not to us as such.. but to her friends and was really making a bold statement about it telling everyone over their chat groups. We didn't really bother much as we always spoke infront of her that we don't think she needs to come to us and make any statements about who she wants to be.. one day she will bring home a girl or a boy and we will welcome them and sit down with them and have a chat irrelavant of gender. 

The issue escalated though .. when she decided she likes one of her closest friends. And asked her to be her girlfriend. They have been in this phase of boyfriend s and being in couples all year and I have told her numerous times even with boys she liked.. that I do believe they are too young to be stressing out over these things but let it be and made no big fuss- as their idea of being a couple is a childish one anyway and aren't doing anything couples do, and didn't want to invalidate whatever it was she was feeling. Now back to the point this girl she likes told her no and that she is straight. This didn't go down well and my daughter started to some extent manipulating the situation. First telling the girl to consider and pushing her.. and then asked her if they can try for a week (mind you we were in lockdown ) and see how she feels. When this didn't work she asked another friend to talk to this girl and tell her how unfair she was being how she made my daughter sad. At this point we intervened sat my daughter down and spoke to her.. we explained that while we have absolutely no problem with her identifying as whoever she wants, she cannot force people or manipulate them into being in a relationship with her irrelavant of gender. This she has understood and since then everything calmed down. 

Now 3 weeks later and with the slight easment of lockdown this girl's mother has invited my daughter to their house for a small pool party on the roof. Only my daughter is invited and the reason for this is that she is the only friend this girl is allowed to have over ( super diciplened parents). Now my issue comes here.. I am very sure this girl's mother doesn't know about the situation above, and don't want this to spill over while I won't be there and not sure how another parent would react. My second issue is if I believe my daughter's feelings are true and don't want to dismiss them, the best solution is to not see this girl until she has put her feelings aside. On the other hand though telling her I don't want her to go might send the signal to my daughter that I'm only doing this because she said she is bi.

Would you send her? I could use covid as an excuse I guess??"
"My boyfriends son has been staying with us a lot more due to the pandemic, including weekdays now. Since we are working he ends up watching a lot of tv during the day. (He is obsessed with Scooby Doo) I have an iPad and our tv is hooked up to the computer. What are some good free apps or online learning programs that are educational but also fun? I’m new to the parenting world and I have no idea where to look or what is right for his age group! He will be starting kindergarten in the fall and it would be nice to get a jump start on learning."
"Im just curious how people are upcycling their carseat? 

We have a rear facing carseat that my daughter is out of and its still in Perfect condition. We cant sell it and even if we tried I doubt anyone would buy it for safety reasons. I cant bring myself to just toss it because there is nothing wrong with it. 

So what have you guys done with them? Im thinking maybe a little chair that could sit on the deck but other than that I cant think of anything else and would love some suggestions! 

Thanks in advance!"
"My 9yo boy has been asking to be homeschooled for a couple of years now. He’s always performed above grade level and been hella bored in school. And the “gifted” program really didn’t enrich his curriculum enough to make a difference. He basically just got extra work. I had looked into homeschooling several times but never really felt like I could pull it off. A few weeks after the lockdown happened, I started looking at resources and stuff and decided this was a good time to try out some things. I know real homeschooling involves trips to different places and more “out of the box” type learning so we obviously haven’t been going anywhere, but I felt like he was doing really well with online resources and reading and stuff. Some days have gone better than others, but overall I felt like we were doing okay. He was excited to finally get to do what he thought he wanted. 

Well yesterday I wasn’t feeling well, I spent most of the day in bed and he spent almost all day on video games or whatever. I asked him to please work on something, anything, he could choose the topic, but he didn’t. I felt too ill to argue so I just gave up. I don’t know if this had anything to do with what happened today so I’m just throwing this part in there. 

His default activity in the morning is to get on his switch, and during lockdown I’ve just let it slide because... well whatever. I don’t know. We usually start on educational stuff around lunch time. But sometimes it’s a bit of a drag getting him to transition. 

So with being sick yesterday and getting tired of the switch being his default activity, last night after he went to bed I put his switch up so he wouldn’t just jump straight on it in the morning. We had errands to run, take the dog to the vet, etc, and when we got home I said he has to do some educational stuff before he gets his switch time today. We got home and I was working on some bills and I heard games in his room. I went in and he switched to an educational tab really quick. I calmly asked what that was about and he immediately started crying (?) and said “I told you there’s something wrong with me.” ((He said that yesterday when I got onto him for getting mad at the dog for bothering him in the car)) Earlier this morning he had gotten mad about something else and had said that again too. I had a brief talk with him about hormones and he would probably start having some really strong feelings that felt like come out of nowhere, and that’s normal to feel some intense emotions as you grow up, etc. trying to be supportive. 

Anyway he went in the living room after that and was pouting or whatever because he got caught, and I looked at his browser history to see how much schoolwork, if any, he had done. The first tab he looked at was one of the educational sites-mental health-video on depression. 

I went and hugged him asked him about it and he just laid there, didn’t say anything. I told him he could talk to me. He just held onto me for a minute and was being really sweet and cuddly and after a little while just changed the subject.

Wtf. I don’t know what to do with this information. We get along pretty well, or I thought we did. He’s my only child, I’m terrified of screwing him up. I don’t know if this was just an over dramatic reaction to feeling like he is “grounded” from video games (he is not) or if this is some lurking issue, lockdown burnout, or what but it just shook me up especially since he won’t talk to me. 

Please be gentle with me, I love my little dude so much."
"I need some feedback. My wife and I are expecting #3 on May 20 and we needed someone to watch my twins while we were at the hospital. With covid going around, and us living in NY where the infected rate is one of the highest in the country we have been very cautious. My mother and her boyfriend lives in Florida and offered to come up to watch them for a few days. I said ok requesting they self quarantine for 2 weeks prior and only go out for groceries and other necessities. She agreed. Now she is up here and is giving me grief that we are being unrealistic asking them to stay home for 2 weeks and that they have been isolating in Florida, which isn't true as they have had her boyfriends kids and grandkids over. We have been isolating for 2 months at this point following NY's guidelines, but apparently 2 weeks is asking too much. I am so stressed out with a little more than a week til our baby is born. Am I being ridiculous, or are they? They agreed to this before driving 18 hours up from Florida."
"Just a sigh of relief via text! We were all prepared with bags packed,  etc. Wife woke up at 4:40 am and shook me awake saying ""I think it's starting"". I get the car started, toss the bags in,  run back up the two flights of stairs to her pained groans. We make it down stairs with many pauses. She says ""I can't stop pushing"", we make it to the car,  she screams ""its happening!"". I call 911 and grab the bath towels I had tossed in the car,  lay them on the ground, she hits the towels on her knees, screams and after some frantic pushing, pulling and unwinding of umbilical cord I got our baby wrapped in a towel. Ambulance arrived to us sitting next to each other on the ground holding our crying 5 minute old little girl.  

911 operator was awesome and helpful as she could be given all the yelling. The firemen and EMTs where stellar.  My wife was amazing. In-between screams she calmy gave instructions and passed information to me and her mother who acted as support staff while tending to our toddler. The hospital staff has been awesome as well.

What a morning! Everyone's okay! 

Happy Mother's Day!


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your congratulations and well wishes! My wife and I have been comforted by everyone's kind words.  We spent the night at the hospital and finally got home a couple hours ago. Our new little one is presently on my lap while my wife takes a much deserved shower. Baby has a thus far prefect bill of health (for seeming so tiny, our first daughter was actually larger at 9lbs, 15oz). 

 I just watched our front yard security system footage of the birth and well.... crazy! Really strange and awesome to be able to watch a play by play of everyone's performance during a moment of near crisis. 

Thanks again all!"
"I am a young single father. I feel like after I had my daughters, I am becoming ""stupider"". I can't write emails, analyze essays, and think critically as well as I did a year ago. I read my essays from September before my girls were born, then I read the essay I just wrote. The difference is a college student vs a 9th grader. Literally that is what the college writing center told me when I asked how bad my recent essay was.

I grew up studying hard, getting straight A's. My high school was basically a college because the curriculum was more advanced and we had actual professors as teachers. I am a current freshman at one of the best colleges for my major but the courses are not challenging at all. I cant take a more advanced class because none of my high school courses has college credit despite colleges acknowledging that my high school is difficult. Im retaking easy courses. My brain is not stimulated. Im losing touch of my critical thinking ability.

I know that I am busy and exhausted, but I was exhausted in high school. I was so exhausted in high school that I contemplated taking my life because the future seemed too difficult. I am nowhere near that level of exhaustion, yet I cant function as well as I did then. I am taking a leave of absence after finals to focus on my girls, but without school, how will I stay educated and not forget everything ive learned? Its already happening despite me being in college.

This sudden drop in mental performance definitely make me feel... useless. I dont know how else to explain it. Im getting dumber as time goes on. No offense to the people out there, but I feel like the simple minded high schoolers who get C's and cares more about vaping and drama than grades. You know those kids when you see them and you wonder how their future will turn out. Only I feel like I am becoming them. I understand their environment plays a very large role in this. My environment changed a whole bunch, which could be why im not mentally performing as well as I used to.

Anyways, what can I do to make sure I'm not losing the quality of my communication or brain capacity. Im definitely not as smart as I used to be..."
"Hi,

I have a 14 MO daughter. She has been consistently above 99% (no humble bragging) and at the beginning it was kinda cool. But now, we got a bit concerned on in case this trends continues, how to raise her so that she can fit in and don't feel left out (especially since she is born to immigrant parents).

I was wondering if there are educators/parents to tall kids out there that can help us? How should we help her grow up confident accepting her difference?Do we have to put her in special sports early on? Any small word of advice is highly appreciated."
"My daughter turns 5 in a month. We don't have a steady housing situation. We are currently at Airbnb which we have been staying at different ones for a few months. We can't get an apartment initially because of credit, now because of lost jobs. We are trying to get a shelter, but they are closed and we are struggling. Soon we won't have money for Airbnb.

What should we do about our daughters school? We don't want her to be behind, but if we move we may be taking her from school to school. That can't be good for her, right? We dont know what to do, any advice would be appreciated.

Fyi we live in the Boston area so things are expensive, but my wife is going to school here so we will have to be somewhat close."
"We have three kids (4yrs, 2yrs, 4 mos) who have been home for almost 9 weeks because of the virus. Normally, the 2 oldest are in daycare and the youngest would have started Apr 1.

At this point, I have realized that I start each day already at my wits end. It is just mentally exhausting to the point that the little conflicts that we could have handled easily before end up spiralling. And it seems like once a day gets off on the wrong foot, it's hard to recover.

And it's not like they are really doing anything that kids their age shouldn't be doing. And anything that is out of the ordinary is understandable given that they've been stuck at home for so long. This is just really hard on all of us.

Thanks for listening."
"My daughter who is a little over 2 years old very much prefers me, her father, over my wife. She often says ""No mom"" and ""dont like mom"". Sometimes it is the first thing my wife hears when she walks in her room in the morning. Needless to say it is starting to have an effect on my wifes morale. She is a stay at home mom so she gets to experience this more often than not and lately seems very beaten up about it.


Any advice on ways to correct my daughter's behavior? We have tried telling her she should be nice. Tried to demonstrate it makes mom sad. Tried putting her in a short time out if she is excessively mean about it. All of the above works temporarily and she will apologize but then be right back at it. Is it just the age?


Advice on making my wife feel more appreciated? She sometimes struggles with feeling like a good mom and this certainly isnt helping those feelings.


For what it is worth, some context around our roles. I am generally the ""fun"" one in terms of energy playing with her - chasing, hide and seek, more physical play. My wife does activities with her and takes her places (not lately). I am more strict than my wife. My wife is much better at trying to work with my daughter about her feelings. My wife is much more ""tender"" when my daughter gets hurt.


Not sure if any of that is helpful but just in case.


Thanks"
"My wife and I are expecting our first child and found a name we are in love with. We were throwing ideas around and finally when this name got thrown in, we both fell in love. 

After a few weeks, I had the realization that my brother’s niece has the same name (my brother’s, wife’s sister’s child)

We have no real connection to them, other than the rare occasions the 2 families get together so it really doesn’t affect my wife and I. I just don’t want to cause problems that every time the name gets brought up, my brother and his wife have to reply with “which one?”

Am I being ridiculous to be concerned with such a loose connection, or should we fall in love with a new name?"
"Hey everyone, new parent here.

For months now, my partner and I have been trying to train our 2 year old to sleep in her own bed without too much issue. Not only does she struggle to fall asleep, as she moves often and will lift her head like she's checking to see if we're there; she also wakes up randomly throughout the night crying and calling for mom. The latter is the problem we need help solving.

We have a fairly regularly routine before bed. Most lights off around 9, and we'll watch a movie, read a book, or play with blocks. If we have tea, she gets her spoon and has some of mom's caffeine-free chamomile tea. Then around 9:30-9:45, we lay her down with some piano music in the background. 

We know we could probably do without the TV so close to bedtime, but there seems to be no real difference between TV nights and non-TV nights.

We tend to stay with her until she falls asleep and then return to our room to sleep, though the frustration of waking up repetitively through the night to put her back to sleep ends up resulting in mom sleeping in her bed/on the floor next to her. I've tried to answer her crying, but she only wants mom. 

We've even tried bringing her bed into our room for a while, and she'll still start crying when she wakes up even though we're in sight.

The only thing we haven't done yet is just letting her cry it out, because (a) we have downstairs neighbors with young children who we don't want to disturb, (b) we're softies, and (c) she'll just walk herself to our room anyway. 

Are we being too coddling by answering her cries? Are there other solutions? Any guidance and direction is appreciated. Thank you so much."
"I wish we didn't have to think about this so seriously, but especially with Covid-19 and my husband working in the front-lines of healthcare, we've had to face an issue that's been plaguing us since our first kid was born. Who do we leave the kids (6M, 3M) to if something should happen to us? Googling about the issue just makes us feel worse. How do we decide between a bunch of bad options? 

Here are our slim pickings options (and note these are our TOP options):

Husband's Side: We live far from family so nobody has seen our kids more than 10 times.

Sibling 1: Male, divorced. Wants kids in theory but more because it's an experience he hasn't had yet and wants to pass on his genes (his words). Good career with good hours, but is very self-involved due to high levels of health anxiety. Spends most of his time complaining to us about his life and mostly ignores the kids, but sends gifts on birthdays.

Sibling 2: Female, married. Has one child (1F). Looks good on paper with a good job now, but work history is unstable and has been let go more than once. She has outsourced most of the parenting to her elderly parents who complain that they have the baby basically 12 hours a day. Husband plays video games or watches TV all day. She lives near family, but has social anxiety and basically avoids all family events and is a shut-in outside of work. Has been nice to our kids during the few, brief meetings we've had.

Parents: Elderly and already strained taking care of baby. Also has back problems so not going to be great with rambunctious boys.

Cousin 1: Female, married with own kid (5F) who is special needs. She seems to be doing well and they seem like good, stable parents, but they are expecting another child and not sure if they want to take on two more. She and my husband were not very close as kids, but have gotten closer since they were the first in the family to have kids.

Cousin 2: Female, married with own kid (2M). Only family member that has always shown a love for kids in general. However, she and her husband have developed radical political views and become alienated from parts of the family. I'm not talking your typical Trump Supporter or SJW. Take it two notches higher. We are on the same side of the political spectrum and are uncomfortable with their views.

Cousin 3: Female, married with one kid (3F) and unlikely to have more kids. Has been the nicest of all the family to our kids and shown the most interest (given the limited amount of time we've spent with them). However, she is a distant cousin that we don't know well and it feels awkward to give our kids to relatives of relatives that we don't know very well.

My side (even slimmer): I have no siblings and no family other than my parents that has actually met my kids since most of my next of kin lives in another country and I haven't been back since childhood. None of these are real options.

Parents: Also elderly. I had a really unhappy childhood growing up. My parents have since mellowed and adore my kids and will move wherever they need to to take care of them. But they don't speak English well and would have trouble communicating with my kids.

Cousin 1: Female, married with one kid (2F). Lives in the US with her American husband. I've only seen her twice since I moved away when I was a young kid. She seems nice and they are older so well-established in their careers. I can't tell what kind of parent she is, other than they take their kid on vacations to Hawaii and Disney and whatnot.

Friend 1: Female, married with two kids (6M and 9F). She's probably the closest to us in values and parenting style. However, we've drifted apart in the last 5 years just because we have busy lives and don't live super close. She also doesn't live near any of our family.

So there you have it folks! Hopefully none of these people are on reddit to read my glowing reviews of them. We are a loss as to what to do and just go around in circles from one option to the next. Thanks for bearing with me...it was helpful just to type things out. Any thoughts or advice on how we should approach this are welcome!

TL;DR - We don't have any good options for guardian for our kids. We've been avoiding the decision, but covid-19 is forcing us to make a choice. I've turned to asking internet strangers for help."
"My daughter (12) wrote me a letter yesterday, saying how great of a mom I am and how I'm the best. She said she would love me forever and she knows how fortunate she is and she's very grateful to have a mom like me. My husband did not help her write it at all. I was in tears. We adopted her at 8 months old (as well as my son), and I'm always worried that they resent me for taking them from their birth country or that I'm not a good enough mom. It was really touching. I just wanted to share."
"So long story short, I'm looking for advice on how best to approach this. 
My daughter has anxieties about sleeping by herself and it's been a uphill battle. Me and her mother are divorced. So at my house for the last few years I've been teaching her how to sleep alone. At her mum's place that doesn't happen. 

Recently though it's got better. Although shes been coming out with excuses like her arm hurts. Couldn't find anything wrong. I had to take her to the doctor and they couldn't find anything either. 

Then few days later when she goes back to her mum's (they've recently started to get her to sleep alone) she's complaining of her leg hurting. So her mum takes her to the hospital in the middle of the night. Takes her in a wheel chair... Doctor doesn't find anything wrong and when my daughter was questioned about it she couldn't find a origin point of the pain. Doctor even asked does she complain often about pains? To which her mother said no. Also just to say I wasn't there. 

So her mother believes it all but I'm not so sure. My daughter is a lovely person and very honest. But I think she's using these excuses either for attention (, they have a small baby) or because she's worried about sleeping.

I don't know if I should talk to her mum at the risk of an argument or say nothing at all. I'm just worried that all the meds and painkillers could hurt her. Not to mention the fact that this shouldn't be allowed to think it's alright."
"I made two abstract art pieces after watching a YouTube tutorial and she is over excited about them each time she sees them on the wall. It gives me a good confidence boost, because she's so happy each and every time she sees them."
"Hi guys! My LO is 11 mths and he will turn a year old this mth. However, he is still learning how to self feed. He is not comfortable to swallow food like chicken and broccoli. Often enough he gags and vomit. Any tips? Appreciate the help"
"Sorry in advance for the long post, just want to list the things I'm struggling with for if anyone can assist... 

I thought I'd maybe come to Reddit for help, along with the help of my mothers. 😅

My fiance and I had a beautiful baby girl on the 7th of May. Brought her home yesterday. It's been challenging to say the least and we're waaay out of our comfort zones. 

If anyone has any advice to offer, I'd appreciate it so much.

1. I've got her on both formula and breastmilk. I decided to try it that way because yesterday drained me entirely when I was only breastfeeding and I was awake until 6am in tears.

2. We started out giving her 30ml when she'd get a bottle of breastmilk. The formula instructions told us to give 60ml of it so we changed to that.

3. Pretty sure I overfed her yesterday because she was up most of the night, screaming and crying. Kind of like tonight.

4. She only drank 20ml at one point this afternoon which was odd and then later I gave her the normal 60ml.

5. We've given her gripe water and another brand ofn colic drops on her dummy.

6. She sleeps like a princess when she's with one of us, but as soon as we put her in her cot she's awake. I don't want her to sleep in the bed with us because of the risks.

7. She's currently awake at 02.07am, crying and screaming every few minutes, and we're trying to get gas out. I last gave her a bottle at 11pm, and then put her on the breast about 15 minutes ago and she drank a little bit.

No idea what we can do or change, so if anyone can offer some words of wisdom, that'd be amazing."
"I confess. I have accepted defeat. In this Quarantine, between me and wife and our 2 yr old, it's either one of us constantly looking after her or it's youtube if we want ANY time together. I am not proud of it. But I have realized it. Unless day cares open, it's youtube for her.

What are some good YouTube videos for a 2 yr old girl? All we know of is Blippi, which she really loves.

Any other good shows on YouTube? Or any other digital media?

Wanted to add that I am looking for Educational content. That's why I like Blippi. My daughter has learnt so much from it. Words that I learnt when I was like 25 years old (not a native English speaker), alphabet, counting, making 4 to 5 word sentences. I think this is better than most of the mindless cartoons"
"I got into a heated discussion with another parent today about whether it's worth it for a kid to learn a skill earlier than their peer group. For instance, some kids learn to ride a bike at 4, some at 6. Does it really matter when both are riding equally well by age 7? Same for reading, soccer, swimming and similar things which all seem to even out within a few years, at least within socioeconomic peer groups. Is it worth it for parents to try really hard to teach their kids skills early (say, age 3-5) when the kid can naturally pick up those skills when they're a bit older (5-8)? I'd love to hear from parents whose kid picked up a skill earlier than expected, and if it had any long term benefits."
"I recently discovered she has her first cavity, and it broke my heart. Growing up I always had trouble with my teeth, and theres no way i'll let my daughter ever go through that. My grandmother knows just how bad i had, seeing as how shes the one who raised me more or less. Thats why it kills me when she goes behind my back and gives her sweet tea instead of milk or water. Or lets her eat a snack cake instead of some fruit or something. I've tried to ask nicely. I've ever tried being kind of a dick about it. Not much of one, since the womans terrifying and set in her ways, but she knows im serious at the very least. Not only that, but we just lost my grandpa last year after an awful 6 month long battle with cancer, so i hate to do anything that might make her even the slightest bit sad, but its my baby girls teeth. Yeah, these teeth will fall out. But so will the next set if she doesnt learn how to care for em.  Any ideas on how i can approach this?"
"Sleep apnea has been ruled out, but otherwise doctors don't seem to take it seriously. We feel like we've tried everything. Lavender on feet. Altering schedule for play/relaxing. Down time before bed. Magnesium calm tea. Chamomile tea. Melatonin. Epsom salt baths. White noise machine. Less light in room."
"My 8 year old son has recently developed the bad habit of touching his saliva and wiping it on his nostrils, eyes, behind his ear and other places on his body (but mostly the first three). I can only guess that it could be stress related (now been 10 weeks without school), although he has had a similar habit about a year ago when he was constantly chewing his t-shirt, and still does from time to time. Have any other parents experienced similar habits and what worked well to stop it?"
"So we have a daughter and she’s 6. She wets her pants often. She is the third of four kids and has always been pretty strong willed. The thing is she was potty trained at age three to the point where we would only have the occasional nighttime accident. Then we had our youngest and she regressed a little. We expected that so no big deal. Here we are 3 years later and don’t know what to do. We have also since moved to a new state so I’m sure that didn’t help but it’s getting to be where she is old enough to where I am afraid it will be kind of detrimental to her mental health. We have tried so many things, some have seemed to work for a while but nothing sticks. We have also had medical exams to make sure there wasn’t anything physically wrong. I just wanted to see if anybody has dealt with anything similar or if there is any advice. I just want her to have all the opportunities for anything she wants, but this feels like such a roadblock."
"Like husband &amp; wife go on a getaway for a week without kids and let grandparents watch the kids for a week or something?

I was told the kids may be upset and hold grudges that parents won't bring them nor wait until kids are available to go"
"My 16 month is amazingly picky eater or maybe I'm not great at serving food, I don't know. 
Here's my problem. Son only wants to eat chicken nuggets, pouches or kid granola bars. 
I cook every day for us. I used a variety of veggies and meats. I don't think it's bland? 
How do I encourage better eating behaviours. I'm totally overwhelmed at meal times. Help?!

Edit 1: I appreciate everyone's input! Parenting is hard and I'm trying to do my best

Edit 2: maybe my son read my reddit, but in a shocking display of hunger he ate beautifully this dinner time. Nothing changed but I did offer some flower cut cucumbers. Again thank you for all the positive advice. My partner and I think it's great"
"My kids are 11 and 14 and very smart and over all good. 
I’m not concerned about them getting involved in anything bad online. I don’t feel like monitoring them to be clear. 
What I would like is to be able to turn data and WiFi off and on for things like homework and at night. Is there a middle ground? 
I look into these apps and they seem very intense and very invasive."
"I am a part of several groups and maybe its just the red Subaru effect, but I am noticing a lot of posts dealing with 4yos, big emotions and aggressive behavior. So my question is is there something about 4 or am I just hyper-aware?"
"My son and I have always been very close growing up. He was the kid who always liked to have fun, was always affectionate, wore his heart on his sleeve and well-liked. He's 22 and is a complete stranger to me. His life is mostly his girlfriend (with whom he moved in with), socializing and work. Occasionally I check his FB page and there is always something new that he did or a funny a meme he created. This started after he moved out. I can't help but to feel a bit slighted. What hurts a lot is that his latest post was about his playing cards with his girlfriend's dad last night. He and I used to play cards together. I even wonder if he will remember Father's Day or if he will celebrate with his girlfriend's dad. I'm serious because his girlfriend's dad calls him ""the son I never had."" I won't lie - that pisses me off to hear that. The times that I do speak to him, I cannot hide this angry tone with him. He wouldn't get it. It turns into a power play where if he does call for something, I purposely ignore him for days on out.  My biggest fear is that he's getting to a place where he doesn't need nor want me. I am a relic of his past like a toy."
"

Hello all, 
Do you still take your kids out for walks outside? We stopped going out two months ago and it breaks my heart because my 29 month old twins still ask to go out everyday. We just run in our hallway, play with sand outside our apartment and go up and down stairs some times. City - Budapest"
"Me and my partner are struggling with our 2 year old girl big time. I'm in tears every day and completely clueless what to do. I really need some advice and help from somebody who had similar problems. Any book, personal experience, parenting method would be of great help. 

So my 2 year old was really attached to me before I gave birth and naturally our problems started after birth of her brother. I expect it to be difficult but dear Lord I don't know how to survive at this point. She hates her brother. She is trying to hurt him every day. Pull him of the bed, hit him ect. Also at other times when he makes any sound she is terrified and it sends her in a full blown tantrum that can last for hours. It's impossible for me to keep a newborn quite and her screaming will make him cry and as a reaction she will explode even more. Her tantrums became horrible. She will scream for hours, hitting everything in her way even hitting me and my husband. At times she was also hitting her head and smacking her face. Before her brother was born she was a normal toddler that would cry here and there but nothing significant. But our biggest issue is that she wakes up during the night every two hours and demands to be carried. Every time she wakes up it's screaming until she almost pukes. We are tired and clueless. She is struggling so much it breaks my heart. She is tired all the time. She doesn't get enough sleep. How do we help her. Does it get better.  Please anything will help. Thank you."
"I helped the 4-year old with casting, but he reeled it in like a champ (brim)

and the 8-year-old did the entire casting, luring, and flinging it onto the dock. 

other dads (and moms on mothers day): use shrimp chunks as bait and mostly hide the hook where it can't be nibbled off.

Usually you're supposed to be proud for your own accomplishments but I'm stealing some of their thunder knowing that if I die tomorrow at least they'll have one extra dinner they can eat thanks to their own technique."
"Fifteen (B) and eighteen (A).  

My kids have flooded our house with their showers and baths three times prior (over the course of about eight years, twice within the past five) and have caused major amounts of damage to our house.  We showed them what to do and not to do with baths, shower curtains, etc.  

Today I heard pouring rain in my kitchen.  I rushed out to see water everywhere.  

According to the kids:

Kid A had put the shower head up at an angle so that if turned on, water would shoot straight out into the bathroom.

Kid B reached into the shower without looking and started the shower.  The curtain was closed.  Kid B then started doing their hair and looking in the mirror and let the water run for 5&lt; minutes.  They did not notice the bathroom floor flooding until we ran upstairs and banged on the door.  

A plumber came out just in case and said it isn’t a plumbing issue.  It was the shower head for sure.  

The kids are fighting about who is at fault.  We don’t know how we will pay to fix it.  

We can’t agree on who is at fault so we are coming to the internet jury.

ETA I went upstairs and my 4’9 self stood on the edge of the tub and adjusted the shower head in every insane way possible.  I closed the curtains, not a drop came out."
"There are two schools of thought on this song.
If you’re happy and you know it,

(1) and you really want to show it, clap your hands!

(2) then your face will surely show it. Clap your hands!

Here’s my question: if my face will surely show it, then why am I supposed to clap?"
"My Partner and I have a 9 and a half month old Son. He doesn’t do anything for me, but behaves perfectly for my Partner. When my Partner wakes up with Him in the morning (Usually because I’ve been dealing with him throughout the night) He takes all of his bottle, and sits nicely with him before falling asleep in his arms. He doesn’t scream or cry with him, and he is generally a happy Baby when he is with my Partner. When I wake up with him in the mornings, he will only take a little bit of his bottle, he’s not happy and will only start screaming and crying, and won’t go back to sleep. It just seems as though he never wants to be with Me. Being in Lockdown at the moment, I have to try and persevere with him, but it just doesn’t seem to work, it’ll be even worse when my Partner is able to go back to work as he will be a nightmare for me if I still can’t do anything to keep him happy. What am I doing wrong? Am I a bad Mum? Is it because my son doesn’t like me? Please please help!!"
"Edit:  thank you for the kind words. He is a good guy and we are quite proud of him and his brothers. PS:  she’s a great mom and deserved it. 
He had an amazing brunch delivered to our home today. It was supplied by a variety of restaurants, bakeries, coffee shop, bar and flower shop. It was quite a feast and we barely made a dent in it. She sat there and cried tears of joy and also of sadness that he couldn’t be with us because he lives out of state.  That is one thoughtful kid. Happy Mother’s Day to all your mothers out there."
"I know this topic might have been discussed a lot already but I am not talking about the cargo space of SUV, but the ride height of it. We have a 6 month young and we are thinking if the ride height would make our life easier, what do you guys think about that?

Also, until when do we need to help kid getting in and out of the car? 5 years or 7 years? Does it get tougher to get kid in and out of a sedan when they get older / heavier?"
"My son is 3 years and 2 months. We've been toilet training I would say for about 6-7 months now. He's never been interested in a potty so it's always been one of those little seats you put on the toilet. We've always taken him every 60-90 minutes and sometimes he protests but not always and he always wees when he does get on the toilet. He gets a little treat when he goes as well, stickers did nothing so chocolate it is.

Anyway, 7-8 months later and he still won't go unless we're taking him on a schedule of 60-90 minutes. He never tells us if he needs to go, if we forget to take him he'll just wet himself. He's also only ever pooped on the toilet maybe 3 times? And he doesn't seem to know when he needs to poop. 

My mum is insisting we persevere but it's exhausting and we're going through so many pairs of underwear and he just doesn't seem ready. By his age, he really SHOULD know when he needs to go right?? Would it be OK to put him back in nappies for a couple months and then try again?"
"Where we live (Utah) they’re beginning to open up some public spaces, again. Our local zoo, the mall, the aquarium... 

I miss taking our 2 year old out so much, and I’m sure she does too. These places still have “safety measures” to meet, like walking only one direction through the attractions. She’s not necessarily going to follow the new “rules”, but I could kind of keep her in check. Is it still too risky to take her out once in a while?"
"I know the last few weeks have been challenging for us parents and kids.  This time has started difficult, but lots of good has come from it and I wanted to share some progress as a dad and hopefully be able to help others in a similar situation. 

Me and my wife have been married for 10 yrs we have 2 kids an 8 and 4 yr old, my mom also lives with us since my dads passing.  I am the disciplinary in the household, I strongly believe in the kids being independent, being able to help themselves, taking risks and being resilient.    While me and my wife agree on principles, I find that I am the only one in the house reinforcing them and often times enforcing the rules.  This hasn’t been a huge problem till the quarantine and it started taking a huge toll on my relationship with my 4 year old daughter.  My daughter is treated like the proverbial princess in my house.  She is used to getting her way and calling the shots with my wife and mom.  Since the quarantine, I have been home more and I see the impact of parents not parenting and not setting clear boundaries and this was evident and getting bad with my daughter.  My response was to attempt to redirect and discipline her.  Whether this was to clean up or enforce not eating in the living room or disciple her for sometimes yelling at my mom.  What I noticed was that this in equitable enforcement was causing her and me a tremendous amount of stress.  At one point I couldn’t stand being around her because she just had no regard for rules or boundaries.  Me and my wife have discussed this before and have fought about it before, my plea to my wife has been we need to set rules and enforce them equally and that me being the enforcer constantly is effecting my relationship with my daughter, not because what I am telling her is wrong, but because she thinks dad doesn’t like her or love her when rules are enforced.  This past week I lost it with my wife and my frustration grew with her inaction and in my mind I felt alone, ignored to the point where I wanted to just run away.  We fought about the issue of enforcement again and finally made some progress.  This pst week she agreed to enforce and the results have been astounding.  
1. My daughter controls her tantrums 
2. She has stopped hitting or biting my son (excluding playful)
3. She is more fun to be around, she helps with clean up and knows she has a role to help and contribute 
4. My relationship with her has healed in days as she is sleeping next to me now, where typically she would rather sleep with my wife 

I have iterated the positive outcomes and it has helped my relationship with her and now that she is enforcing I listen for when my kids are not listening and come to help reinforce so the next time she doesn’t have to.  

I am hoping she continues, no one likes to enforce the rules, but if you are alone you will lose and your relationships will suffer.  

Finally, I am thankful that no one is sick and I have my loved ones close to me.

Edit.. grammar .. prob more to correct"
Dad here. My wife and I are expecting our third in a few weeks. We almost named our second child Sienna but went with a different name. We are also in the process of buying a minivan and it’s most likely going to be a Toyota Sienna. Would it be crazy to have a new car and a new baby both named Sienna? My wife thinks so. I’m trying to convince her. Thoughts?
"So I've been working with my daughter to learn how to read. We've been using a book that teaches to read in 100 lessons. We used to do one lesson everyday and we've completed around 50 lessons but now that school has been canceled she refuses to continue with any sort of learning. We've explained to her the issues with COVID and why she can go to school and she completely understands. She just throws a fit if I even mention doing anything even close to school work. 
What do I do?"
"TL;DR: 11 year old son and I watch the show Grey's Anatomy together, with necessary precautions. I'm still concerned that I may be messing him up (though there aren't any signs for that). Plus, 2 episodes with tough topics are coming up, which he will want to see, but I'm not sure if I should let him. 

I'm going to put the Media flair on this, but feel free to change it if it doesn't fit.

So, I have 4 kids, age 14, 11, 9 and 2. I also have a favorite show, Grey's Anatomy. It's a medical drama centered around the lives of about a dozen young doctors, their personal lives and their careers. It is not a children's show and I know this.

My 11 year old son watches it with me. Let me explain how that happened. A few months ago, I was doing a re-watch of the show and was almost done with season 10 (which is where I always stop). It was 10pm or something, and my son was in the kitchen finishing up his math homework. 

From the kitchen table, you can see the living room and the TV. Since my son hates math, he obviously started watching the show rather than doing his math after a while. Eventually, he came over and started watching it with me a little bit. He asked about the characters, what was happening, and so on. He really liked it, especially when it had a few really emotional and wholesome moments later in the episode. So, naturally, he asked if he could continue watching with me. I told him I would think about it. 

That night, I considered it. The thing I was most worried about was the blood and the surgery scenes, but I also remember seeing non-child-friendly stuff on TV as a kid and it didn't harm me. I thought maybe he'd forget about it, but he didn't, and I gave in. I told him he could start watching with me, a few weeks later, when I'd be done with that re-watch and start with season 1 again.

I made a few conditions for watching. Obviously we only watch it together, since that's ""our thing"" from now on. The other thing was that I would be warning him when I knew something bloody would come up, and ask him to close his eyes. He mostly does that, unless it's a really cool surgery he wants to see and he's certain he can take it. We also skip episodes where I think that the topic itself is too much to handle. That hasn't happened often yet. And we discuss decisions that characters make, because they're all likeable but make bad decisions sometimes, and I want him to reflect on that. He's good at that and enjoys the discussions.

Here comes my issue. First of all, I'm still worried that I'm doing something wrong. On one hand, I'm pretty sure I handle it well, but on the other hand, I don't want to, you know, mess him up on accident.

The second thing is that we are at the beginning of season 3 now, episode 5. Episode 15 and 16 are 2 very amazing episodes, but they handle tough topics. A disaster happens, a &gt;!ferry boat accident!&lt;, and in the episode after, the main character Meredith  has a tragedy happen to her: She &gt;!nearly drowns, has a near-death experience and is brought back to life. It is basically a suicide attempt, but not really, since she didn't intentionally jump into the water, she just gave up on trying to swim back up.!&lt; These are the kinds of episodes I would like to skip.

Here comes the issue, though: He will want to see them. Especially once I tell them what they are about (which I will). He will assure me that he can handle it. I don't want to ban him from watching if he really wants to, and I don't want him to just watch them in private without my knowledge, because then I can't be there and talk to him about it. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I know these episodes well, and I would know when to tell him to close his eyes, that's not the issue, it's just the topic and the overall tension itself, I guess.

What should I do? Should I just let him watch and handle it the same way I always do? Should I not let him watch and explain why? If so, how would I help him through his disappointment? The episodes are not super plot relevant, it works if I just fill in the blanks later on, but I've seen them and know he'd be missing out. Am I overthinking this? Or do you think he's just too young for the show altogether?

I appreciate all of you guys' opinions and will gladly answer any further questions you may have regarding the situation. I guess I'm just concerned, as this is for sure one of my more ""questionable"" parenting choices.

**Edit:** So far, everyone has been telling me it's fine. Thank you so much, guys, you have alleviated my worries. I love watching this show with him and now I think I can be a little more relaxed about it. I will watch season 3 episode 15 and 16 with him. Maybe I'll let you guys know how it goes :)"
"Recently I moved in with my fiancé of 7 months, he has shared custody of his 4 year old daughter. The 4 year old is generally pretty good with my dog, but as we are living together I am seeing that she is more large dog friendly. My dog is a small one, but is also a medical alert service dog. Today I had to try explain to her that she can’t jump on my dog because she is little. 

Which she turned around and threw one of the dogs toys at my head. If she has a hard time understanding not to jump on the dog, how should I explain that the dog is a “special” dog. 

My fiancé is trying to explain to her that her moms dog is bigger and can play like that, but mine can’t... but it doesn’t seem like it is clicking. 

So advice on dogs and service dogs to a 4 year old would be awesome, thank you!"
"I'm at a loss. I've had a foster child for about 2 weeks. Each day has become harder and harder to put her to sleep for naps or bedtime. It all started out perfectly, established a routine. Diaper, read, crib and asleep. Now everyday for a week she screams when placed in the crib. At first we consoled her and she went to bed. Now consoling doesn't work, she needs to be picked up or fed again to go to bed. Now none of this works.
We've tried letting her cry it out.  First few times she would cry for 10 mins. Now she cries for 30 mins.  She's getting so upset she's hyperventilating and choking on her cries.  She's learning new screams and is becoming worse and worse. It's a constant battle. Longer and longer each day (not shorter and shorter like every f**king book and website.)
Still, when more often than not she stops crying when we pick her up, but lately she won't ever stop. Nothing calms her down.
No fever, not hungry, not wet. Its getting to the point that she's so overtired she's not even engaging during playtime as muh as she used to. She's not babling as much but only grunting. She's only 8 months old and going through a lot of changes (teething, solids, crawling, etc) but I really think there's something else wrong with her.  Im at a loss and losing my mind with frustration. 
I feel so bad for her. I just want her to find peace and self soothe I but I think she's regressing everyday this goes on."
"Bit of a cross topic rant/advice wanted post.

My little girl is coming up on 9 months and is doing really well but I’m starting to get quite down about the comments I’m getting as I’m still breastfeeding.

I’ve been working in conjunction with a dietician and specialist paediatrician as she has a dairy allergy and whilst I imagined I would have stopped breastfeeding by 7/8 months, I’m not going to until she is just over a year. This is for a few reasons- 1. She absolutely hates the hypoallergenic formula (don’t blame her, it’s disgusting), 2. It’s easy to control her intake and make sure there’s no cross contamination and 3. Nutritionally, this is the best thing for her. 

My breastfeeding journey hasn’t really been supported at all from the beginning by people around me, my MIL is a nightmare about it and even though my SO sticks up for me, I’m constantly hearing stupid comments from her and that whole side of the family. I don’t get why there is such a stigma attached to it. I’m feeding her what’s best for her, she’s growing well and by that point, I’ll be exclusively pumping so what is the problem? If it’s not them, it’s other friends telling me how hard it’s going to be to pump at work and I just don’t want to be beaten down by it constantly, the negativity just doesn’t help. 

Just wondering whether any other redditors have dealt with a similar situation and what you did to mitigate it because it’s really starting to knock me."
"My LO has been running away from his father and I. He even left the house without us a few days ago. We’ve secured the place with alarms and such since the incident, but I’m wondering if there are any books for kids, that will go over the dangers of running off? 

He just turned 2 a few months ago and he is hell bound on being independent, I’ve discussed it with him and he repeats what I’m saying, but still tries to run off on our walks.

Edit: any books to read to him would be greatly appreciated."
"Looking for hope for the future! I currently live in NYC and have one baby in daycare for $1650 / month. (That's a pretty middle-class option for NYC unfortunately. Costs range from $1200 - 2800 for full time home care / daycare, and start at $3200 / month for a nanny.) I'm expecting another baby at the end of the year so my costs will either go up to $3000 / month if I put them both in daycare or thinking of just getting a nanny for the extra 200-300 / month for the added convenience. Once both kids are in school, do you find that you spend that amount on your kids still? Or do you get some semblance of control over your budget again? Basically I'm trying to figure out if these are temporary expenses for a few years or if kids will always be this expensive and I should be looking for a job that makes more money so I can afford life again. Like do you just put this money towards their college funds once they start kindergarten? Spend it on clothes and food and extracurricular activities for them? Actually have savings and dispensable income again? TLDR: once your kids started school full time, what did you reallocate childcare expenses to in your budget?"
"*throwaway account*


So here's some context. Our son (12 ) is on the high functioning side of the spectrum with some depression/anxiety issues. 


He's expressed an issue in PC gaming recently, so we used some of our extra cash to buy him a pretty low powered PC for simple games. Minecraft, Roblox etc. But since then, even discussing with him the time limits and when he's allowed/not allowed to use it. He'll sneak on to his PC to use it in various ways. 

He's quite angry, argumentative, defiant and violent. I've had to patch a few holes into doors over the past few years. But when he's confronted with his actions and the consequences he breaks down I to crying and exclaims ""IT'S MY ANXIETY! I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

Even his therapist has argued that our son doesn't know how or even doesn't want to face his actions. Despite therapy and constant communication in the house, it seems he's only getting worse over the years."
"I currently have a 1.3 months old daughter and am pregnant with my son who will be born in November. We are thinking of purchasing a house and do not have a long term obligation to it. (Probably a 10 year mortgage, attached to living in it for 5 years, and may rent it out for the remainder). So, how long can the kids share a room? At what age would you split the children considering they are boy and girl.      



Thanks,"
"Hi parents!

New parent here to a wonderful 3 months old redheaded boy who I absolutely love.

My wife and I are a bit worried we will ruin our child's sleeping behavior.

Currently, he sleeps in our bed with us, at the edge of the bed (secured, of course), my wife in the middle and me to the side. We have a crib but our bed is shorter than the crib, so we can't see him from our bed, and so we felt safer to have him sleep with us. He also sleeps better this way. 

Usually, most nights his ""long sleep"" for the night starts at around 9 or 10 and usually lasts between 3-4 hours, then the next sleep after feeding/changing is about 2-3 and then another 2-3. Sometimes longer sometimes shorter.

We found out recently that the FASTEST way to get him to sleep is to put him in a carrier on one of us - he usually falls asleep this way within 10 minutes (as opposed to an hour+ it usually takes when we're trying to get him to fall asleep in bed). After he falls asleep in the carrier for like an hour (during which we relax and watch TV or something), we very gently move him to bed and go to bed ourselves.

Are we endangering his sleeping behavior by getting him to fall asleep ""easily"" in the carrier? I'm worried this will be the only way he falls asleep and I don't want to ruin him this way. 

On the other hand, when he's fussy and cranky and not calm, we can get him to calm down and sleep fast in the carrier - why should I let him suffer?

We won't ruin anything long-run if we keep getting him to sleep mostly in the carrier.. right?

Oh, I didn't mention but, obviously due to COVID-19 we don't even get to take him on walks. I was told around 5-6 PM is when many babies get antsy, and taking him on a stroller walk helps them, but we can't do that right now.

Sorry for the wall of text, I really love the hell out of him and don't want to mess up. Looking to the wisdom of the masses!"
"I heard Daughter running through the house yelling “fuck you up.” I took her to her bedroom and calmly explained that was a very bad word and I better not hear her say that again. 

I asked where she heard it and wouldn’t tell me. Then she started crying and said it was a song. I told her to tell me the lyrics and she said “up town fuck you up, up town fuck you up... don’t believe me just watch” 

So I told her how to properly pronounce funk and now she wants to know what fuck means and why it’s bad LOL

Happy Mother’s Day. Cheers lol"
"My 9 year old daughter has been having some extreme behaviors as of late. I am sure some of it has to do with the current state of the world but we have always had issues with behavior. She was adopted when she was 2 years old and has some disordered attachment issues. She has been in therapy on and off since age 2 and has been seeing her current therapist since the start of the school year. 

Last night the kids decided to cook dinner for mother's day. My wife and I were in the bedroom and went out to see what was going on when we heard crying. We discovered that the 9 year old had dropped some of the food on the ground. Our 6 year old ended up saying something like ""Oh, no"" but the 12 and 13 year olds went over to help her clean it up. No one yelled at her but she started crying and apologizing. My 6 year old made a comment that she didn't realize was a little snarky and that really set the 9 year old off. She started screaming and ran up to her bedroom. I tried to coax her down for dinner but she said she wanted to stay in her room. We waited for a half an hour and she didn't come out so we told her we were going to start eating. She came downstairs, saw us eating, and that triggered a whole new meltdown. She couldn't believe we were eating without her. I explained why but it didn't matter to her in that moment. My wife and I ended up allowing her to sleep in our bedroom last night. We talked about what happened and she seemed better. 

This morning she had another meltdown after I told her it was time to come inside so she can do her school work. She was on the trampoline with our 13 year old and he came inside as well but she refused. She just laid on the trampoline screaming at the top of her lungs and crying. I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbors called child protective services. Good thing they know us well because she sounded like she was being abused. She ended up not doing her Zoom meeting with her class and is still refusing to do the work. Even my 13 year old who normally fights me over school work has been trying really hard today in hopes that the 9 year old will follow along. It hasn't been successful.

Any ideas on things we can do? Sticker charts and things like that are extremely triggering to her so we avoid those."
"I feel like I am going to explode out of love. All evening my 2year old has called me to the big bed to cuddle and kiss him. He is supposed to sleep right now but he just wants to talk about animals and his favourite story on Spotify and kiss and hug. 

Yesterday was a heavy day and there was a lot of frustration so I just want to take my time to really cherish these moments."
"Hey all. My husband and I have two kids (under 5) and we grew up in Texas. My husbands family is there, all our friends, etc but right before my first born was born my parents moved to Georgia so we moved there because it was my first kid and I didn’t know what I was doing. Anyways, since we moved, we’ve been wanting to move back to Texas (Austin) and I’m miserable here. I do love my parents and how much they love my children, but I never had a great relationship with them growing up and sometimes it gets to me mentally. I feel like the best thing for my family is a fresh start somewhere more less attached to my parents. My only hold up is the guilt I would feel for taking my kids away from my parents. Anytime I mention moving my parents get really upset. But I personally feel trapped. Also, my brother has no kids and probably won’t for a long time and so they have no cousins, no other family here, just my parents.  TLDR; am I a bad parent for taking my kids away from my parents?"
"Our bernedoodle is showing increased signs of aggression against my 3 (almost 4) year old. It started with her nipping at our child whenever she got in her personal space or made her nervous with a lot of chaos (making loud animal noises, jumping, chasing, just been really hyper) we worked really hard to teach our toddler respect for  both of our dogs personal space and to be gentle and calm with them and we have made pretty good progress with our child, the problem seems to be with our bernedoodle, within the last week she has nipped at our child’s face twice. I saw both instances and I feel they were totally unprovoked. A background, we got the bernedoodle when she was 6 months old (my child was a newborn we already had a 1 year old male dog) she wasn’t treated very good and was really skittish and fearful of men. We have come along way with her and she Is a friendly loving girl, very close to me and our other dog, she’s good with my child other then this nipping thing. She has never drawn blood or left a mark it’s more of her warning our 3 year old but I am very nervous one day she will hurt her. I’m not ready to give up on our dog but I’m feeling so scared and anxious about the whole thing. Any advise?"
"My 15 year old daughter has depression, and her depression is affecting her drive to succeed in school. As a result, she is getting very bad grades. She currently has straight Fs, and she has no desire to improve her grades. I don't know how to make her want to improve her grades. I've tried letting her fail, and she doesn't care if she does. I've hired tutors for her, but she doesn't take it seriously. She is in therapy, but it is useless because she doesn't take it seriously. I've taken her phone, but she will just lay in her room if she can't have her phone. Whenever I try to talk to her about improving her grades, she says that I'm ""putting her grades over her mental health"". I know she has depression and I try to be understanding, but still, straight Fs isn't good. I know she can do better than this. I worry that this lack of effort is going to negatively impact her future and that she will have an adulthood filled with poverty because of her unwillingness to work. I just don't know how to get through to her. How can I get through to her?"
"So my youngest son (just turned 7 years old, grade 1) just finished his first zoom class. It was phys ed focused (jumping jacks, planks, burpees, crunches, etc.). I’m shocked at his lack of focus &amp; motivation. He was the only kid that barely put any effort into this and stopped about 3/4 of the way through. He started picking his nose &amp; gave himself a nosebleed so didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye/sign- off. Any floor exercises he was doing were out of camera view so no one saw but I’m so disappointed! He whined his foot hurt but I know that’s not true. I know in the school/class environment he focuses more &amp; trues harder so part of this is doing it at home. What suggestions does anyone have for how to approach &amp; discuss this with him? I want him to be motivated to try his hardest at anything he works at."
" Not sure emotional strength is the right phrase but it is how I think about it. My 4 year old son has issues that no matter what negative thing happen he goes straight to screaming and crying at the top of his lungs. This can be trivial stuff to me and you but to him he feels like it is the end of the world. Stuff like his treat breaking in half could set it off. He will hold onto something negative for hours on end. I want to help him learn to cope with this stuff, for his sake and mine. Any recommendations would be appreciated."
"I'm on my phone so please forgive me. I just need to express my feelings I guess. I've had the worst mother's day. I got text messages from friends, family and even co-workers telling me happy mother's day this morning, but my husband forgot. Not only that we're not in a place we can't cook right now so we have to get take out a lot so I spent half an hour in my car waiting on waffle house for breakfast. We were supposed to go look at house today, my husband would rather nap. So we did nothing, got nothing done that needed to be done. I'm just really upset and have done a lot of crying today."
"I feel so guilty, oh my god. This might be long but I need advice. 

So my almost 5 year old goes to pre-k at a private early childhood center (meaning they aren’t following the public school system and have been open for essential employees kids). Texas is stupidly going into “phase II” on the 18th which is supposedly opening up childcare. I say “stupidly” because the cases are still going up here and the governor has already started opening the state up. 

So this is our situation: my husband and I have been working from home this entire time. He is on the phone in our apartment living room from 9-5 and I am on and off my computer for my job 8-4ish. My job is light so I try my best to make time for my 5 year old. HOWEVER we have a few problems:

-She has some mild-to-moderate sensory issues that have flared so badly. She’s regressing and is woefully addicted to electronics at way too young of an age because we are struggling to watch her and work at the same time. It’s horrible and I feel horrible. She’s started using baby talk for some reason and just gets obsessed with things and whines incessantly. 

-I am currently smack in the middle of treatment for Lyme disease. Aside from feeling like shit from the disease, I have a PICC line placed and have to do antibiotics fusions daily which make me even more tired. My job is super light but I’m still having trouble keeping up due to feeling so bad. Let alone giving my daughter the attention she needs. 

-my husband is slipping in his job performance because it is literally phone based and our daughter tries to get his attention all day. We don’t have an office or a desk in another room or anything so he can’t lock himself away. 

I’m considering sending her back on the 18th. It’s making me sick to my stomach but I’m trying to weigh pros and cons. They are very careful (no parents allowed it, extra cleaning, temps at the door). 

What would you do? I need to take care of myself and her the best I can."
"My 2 year old refuses to eat most of the time. He will usually eat one meal per day. He always protests for milk, and juice, but if we cook him anything, he will pout and refuse to eat it. It's really stressful, and gets me worrying a lot. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?"
"4week old ; breastfeed; won’t sleep more then 30 min on his own,when latched and we both fall asleep he’ll sleep about 2hrs but only next to me. Any suggestions,tricks? 

I’ve tried swaddling (works at times) put a worn shirt of mine next him, bath before bed....gaining weight so I’m providing enough I think gave him a little formula and he threw it up...just out of ideas..."
"I'm going to be a step Dad to a wonderful (for the most part) 11 year old girl.  My fiancee and her ex husband have an amicable relationship (him and I get along very well actually), and he is a good Dad.  

I just want to be the best step Dad I can be, but I have no idea where to start.  My fiancee, her daughter and I all live together (for a month now) and it's going well.  I just have no idea how to ""step Dad"".   Especially in the ""how to discipline"" area.  Any advice would be appreciated."
I very recently left my husband which is my children’s dad and it was very toxic relationship and abusive for so many years and I finally gathered up the courage to leave him. If you want more insight you can look back at my previous post.but My oldest who is 5 saw a lot of things that went down and I’m honestly concerned about her...she’s been very quiet since I left her dad and she just keeps to herself and goes on the iPad. She’s usually not like that she’s normally jumpy has a lot to say. Plus I’m concerned that I’m gonna rock her world even more because I might have to give our dog away because it’s gonna be hard to take care of a dog. But I feel super bad because she got that dog for her birthday and I know how much it means to her...so what’s the best steps I can take to help her? Also should try my best to keep the dog?
"Hi all! 
 I have a 1 year old (6 months or so away from being 2!). I have yet to be answered about this, so i figured i’d hop on here and see what you all have to say. As we all know toddlers are constantly babbling and saying words here and there and pointing and doing all sorts of fun stuff. I have one question though, how did you determine was the best time to go through word books,learning numbers and colors, etc with your child? My son is full of energy and i’m still observing him to watch when his down time energy is so i can sneak an educational book and have time teaching him! I’m not at all worried about his development with language or anything else. But just like anyone else I do want to expose him to more words and specific ones even though i sports cast to him ALL day. Any advice would be wonderful’ (:"
"I was so thrilled for my daughter to get into a Spanish Immersion school. We have had an amazing experience. However, online learning is a whole different experience for us than that of my friends with kids. 

I’m doing my best to keep up the Spanish at home, but my fluency does not reach beyond the courses I took in college. Is anyone else in this situation? I have found several great resources, but more than anything I would love to chat with others in the same situation."
"My girlfriend is pregnant. We didn't plan it. We were only a few months into our relationship; to be honest, we barely even know each other that well. We should have been safer, but we got unlucky, and here we are.

She's always wanted to be a parent and has taken things in stride. Part of me suspects she may have even been angling for this, but that's another story, I guess.

Me on the other hand, I have taken things poorly. I""ve been adamant against kids most of my life, and while I might have softened a tiny bit recently, I absolutely don't want to have one right now. But I'm no longer in a position to make that decision. My girlfriend wants to keep it, of course, that's her choice to make.

The relationship was pretty great to start, but a few months is also not anywhere close enough to make a lifetime commitment.

I'm trying to be supportive but feel as if I'm failing. The relationship has already taken a hit, given the tension our different opinions have caused. I'm borderline devastated when I start thinking about the opportunity cost of the next 20 years. I am going to try to get some professional help because I don't know what else to do. 

I know I'm going to have to step up to my responsibility, but if I do that with resentment, it's hard to see how things can be good.

Has anyone been in this situation, and had it work out well in the end?  Is there anything positive that you could tell me?

I'm trying to keep in mind the fact that it's not always easy to predict what will make you happy in the future. But frankly, that's providing a minimal amount of relief. Mostly I am fixating on the negatives."
"I’m a first time dad (24yo). I thought we would have help these first couple months since my family lives close. That’s whenever all this started getting worse. My daughter was born on March 24 and since I’m an “essential employee” I still work. My wife is home alone with no help and I’m so tired from work that I’m barely an asset. At this point we would both run over a family of penguins with a tank for a nap.

All in all it’s been really tough. Tougher than I was prepared for. It’s still worth it, I get to see her and listen to her weird noises. It’s just really hard. I’m hoping this lets up so we can get help from my parents. They are slowly reopening my state so maybe soon.

Honestly I just wanted to post this to vent a little.
My little Maxine is my whole world, I just wish the world was a better place right now."
"Before I continue, I will let you know that english is not my first language and therefore it can be some mistakes. And I'm also writing on my phone. 

So, we have a kid. He is 11 years old. He is born in Iceland, but have lived in Norway for the past 9 years. He has family he visits once-twice a year. His mother is also Icelandic, and does speak icelandic with him. He chooses to communicate in norwegian and prefer it that way. 

I'm his bonusmom, I do not speak icelandic. I understand some though. So at home we speak norwegian together. (His mom is my partner.)
He speaks norwegian at school and everywhere else really.

His maternal grandparents (who also live in Norway) is giving him and his mother a hard time because of him not speaking icelandic. They have tendencies to complain a lot to his mom (he is not eating healthy enough, he has to much screentime, he is to fat, he is not speaking enugh icelandic etc) and we are sick of it. He is a healthy kid, with normal weight and has a good diet (they see him in the weekends and school holidays, and at those times he will get some candy, but no more than other kids). He also prefers norwegian.

We would probably be more on him, with learning bretter language when it comes to icelandic. But, he has dyslexia and we are struggling with basic skills in norwegian and english, which is the two languages he has at school. At school he is receiving extra help with learning to read and write better. At home this means 45 minutes arguing before he does his homework. Therefore we don't want to push him, when it comes to learning icelandic. 

I have reached out to professionals, asking them what we can do about the situation..but what do you guys think? Should we force the language on him or tell the grandparents to shut up? 

We believe that forcing him will only make it harder. For now he has interest in learning icelandic through some apps for younger children and he does talk a bit with his mom. His paternal grandparents live in Iveland. As well as his father, some aunts and uncles and cousins. None of them make a big deal and they do understand each other, even when it's a mix of icelandic, norwegian and danish. 

His maternal grandparents do not say anything about his cousin here in Norway, who do not say a word in icelandic. He just refuse, because he lives in Norway. He understand, but do not talk. (He is turning 6 in the summer). The other kids speak icelandic in various degrees, but none of them have dyslexia and all of them have two icelandic parents living together, we speak mainly norwegian at home because of me and him."
"I just need to speak... not looking for advice but I’m just really shaken up. My 3.5 year old daughter choked on a slice of peach today. Full on choking... she couldn’t cough or make any noise. Four thrusts and I was anle to dislodge the food. I have never been so happy to hear her cough and cry. By far the most terrifying moment of my life. I’m just glad I was in the same room when it happened. My husband was outside and didn’t know what happened until it was over and I had gotten her settled down. I can’t get the image of her panicked face out of my head though. I know it will get better, but right now I’m terrified. If you think your child is old enough not to choke on things... better to be safe and cut them up. I know I will be going forward."
"My daughter is on the petite side (49"", 58lbs) and I managed to keep her in a full car seat until 8yo (the seat says it's good still for well over her weight).  Once we started picking up friends for playdates and sleepovers she became extremely embarrassed that she was still in a carseat to the point of tears.  I realize that 8yo IS old for a carseat and I have never seen another child her age in one.  But the boosters seem soooooo unsafe!!  It's killing me, it's been months and I'm still not okay with it.   I'm very safety conscious and the difference between the two is overwhelming.  I bought the one with a full back, which looks like a slim carseat but it doesn't attach to the car and only stays in place with the normal seatbelt.

The thing moves around and feels so loose, it's honestly stressing me out. Even with the seatbelt on, it just feels so loose and unsecured! I tried to find more detailed info online about their safety but could find absolutely nothing useful other than they are the safest for kids her age, blah blah blah.

Has anyone felt the same and managed to strap the booster in like a real carseat to better secure it?  I can literally picture her sliding around in a side-impact crash. There is just no way this is safe!"
"How do I do this? She cant take no for an awsner. Everytime we tell her ""no"", it turns into a 2 hour fight. Today I sent her to the neibours to drop something off, from the window I told her to hurry up and come home. She argued with me and then took forever to cone home. I explained to her that her brother has a reading class at 1130 and the girl next door has one at noon so once EVERYONE is done, they can play. ( the rule is everyone has to do there video calls then they everyone can play) she argued and argued. I sent her to her room where she comes out every 30 seconds and it feels like she is intaginiouses me. I am very short tempered so I put her in the room so I have time to calm down so I can talk to her without loosing it but holy shit she makes that hard. She is the sweetest kid when she wants to be but she is so strong willed and stubborn. We decided tonight she doesnt get her phone or TV at bed time( since all the craziness started she will stay up till 11 or 13 watching youtube, and I normally dont care but its catching up with her. Before all this started she would go to bed around 7 and be sleeping by 830. I need help, I realize I dug myself this hole but how do I get out of it. How do I tell her no without fighting for 2 hours. She screams and yells with us but other people she doesnt. I'm just done."
"Part rant, part advice-seeking. My 9y daughter has a tendency to lose her patience easily, and one of the first things she does is immediately pull out the blame finger, and it drives me nuts. Can't focus on school work?  It's the laptop's fault. Gets hurt while rough housing? It's her little brother's fault. Let her shoes outside in the rain? It's her friend's fault. I'm trying to drive home that I don't care whose fault it is, and that I want it fixed or that I want the story as it happened. Anyone else's fault in here?  No idea what to do."
"My husband and I have been together for 9 years. In the beginning, I got along really well with his mother. She was really determined to make me feel like part of the family. Honestly, she's a wonderful lady who raised an awesome son (she has two other sons, who are cool too) and has great intentions for everyone. She volunteers, makes kickass crafts, and is overall a very generous and giving person. And yes, it's from a genuine desire to help, which is amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER.

&amp;#x200B;

When my husband and I got engaged a few years back, things started to change. Lots of backhanded comments, passive-aggressive insults thinly veiled as jokes, and outright put-downs (you're JUST his wife, I'm his mother). We got pregnant shortly after our wedding, and now I'm an expectant mom with an increasingly long list of fears and worries, most of which related to my MIL and her behaviour once the baby is born. The thing is, I can see she's a good person with good intentions who wants good things for me, my husband, and for our baby, but my experience with her over the past few years has been increasingly peppered with negativity. She has VERY strong opinions about how things should be done (what people wear, how mealtimes should work, how mothering should be, etc.), and when things are not done her way she has very specific responses: 1. make a snarky comment and does not let you forget that she's seriously judging you, 2. tell you you're doing everything wrong and trying to do it for you. My husband does NOT notice when she does these things. She outright called me a bitch in front of EVERYONE because I was doing better than her at a card game during one of our weekly visits, and no one flinched until I called her out and told her that that was inappropriate. Then my husband was quick to support me, but again he does not pick up on when she is being rude when she does it. Most of the time when I call her out, she tells me I'm being overly sensitive OR that I'm being disrespectful by not taking the ""joke"".

&amp;#x200B;

She did this A LOT with the wedding, even though she kept saying that she knew it isn't her day, and that she had hers, which makes me worry that it'll be the same with parenting. I want her to be a part of my daughter's life, especially since they live so close, because as a kid my relationship with my grandparents was so important to me. But I also want her to give me the space I need to learn how to do this whole parenting thing, privately. Because I know I'm not going to be great at everything off the bat, but I can't get better if she just steps in and tries to do everything for me. I want to go through the embarrassing parts of learning to breastfeed, for example, with just me and my husband, but she wants to be super involved with that too. Add the MAJOR differences in opinions (she thinks I should only breastfeed, whereas I want to pump and let my husband do some of the feeling), and I'm just really stressed out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that some of this is her wanting to help and doing it the only way she knows how, and some of it might be stemming from insecurity because I tend to get the princess treatment from her husband and sons. I was raised in an all girls household, so I try to include her as much as possible, because girl power. She has admitted that she always hated spending time with other girls/women because she never felt she was the center of attention (this also worries me, because I'm expecting a daughter. there have been more than a few comments about how baby girls are manipulative b\*\*\*\*es, mostly in a joking context, but it just gets to me). I get that she was the only woman in the house and that it's hard to share the spotlight, but I'm not the type that just wants to storm in and take the show. I just want to exist and have a place too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's been going on for a while, but it's all coming out now because yesterday was mother's day. We drove an hour to go get her some KFC because it's her tradition, and then sat outside in the cold so we could have a socially distanced visit. My husband mentioned that I had received a lot of well wishes, and she felt the need to emphasize that I don't count yet. She had made this very clear to my husband, who, not knowing any better since he's new to this parenting thing too, took her word for it and did not do anything special for me for mother's day. I'm aware opinions are split on this, so I didn't make a big deal of it and just treated myself for the day. He felt SO bad when I got a lot of calls and messages though, wishing me a happy mother's day and insisting that I count, so he ended up doing a lot of little things to make my day easier (massage, dishes, cleaning, fancy mocktails, etc.). I know he's probably going to beat himself up over it in secret, and I feel terrible for him.  


TL;DR - My MIL and I have VERY different views on motherhood (and also other things), and when our views are not the same she makes demeaning comments or tries to take over and do things for me. I'm worried she'll try to do this with my baby, and that I won't get to take my space as a mom because of it. I want what's best for my little girl, and I want to do what I can to salvage my relationship with my MIL too, but I am so tired of being put down and refuse to let her dictate how to live my life and raise my child. If anyone has any insight, it would be greatly appreciated."
"Okay, at first it was funny. Our two-year-old tells me to be quiet when she doesn’t like what I’m telling her. Doesn’t want me to tell her to put her shoes on, or come to the bathroom when she needs to pee, or to eat with her spoon instead of her fingers.

Now it’s getting really annoying. Sometimes I just “fulfill her wish”, and ignore her for a while. That makes her more angry, obviously. We don’t do time-outs or spanking. Is it possible to get her to knock it off, or do I just have to wait for her to grow out of this one?"
"Hello fellow parents. Like many of you, we are navigating the world while we #StayAtHome with our 3 &amp; 5 year old kids. 

Recently, our city has begun lifting the restrictions, and a few of our neighbors (who seem eager to get their kids and themselves out of the house) have just been letting their kids roam the neighborhood, often unsupervised. They now come to our house multiple times a day asking for our kids to play.

Here's the dilemma: we want our kids to have friends down the street, and we want to have good relationships with neighbors...and we want to help everyone to be safe! We do not seem to share similar philosophies with these parents on how to handle physical distancing.

How are you handling the conversations with neighbors and friends? 

We thought of putting out humorous signs to remind people that this isn't yet over, but are not convinced it will make a difference. Here are some examples we found:

[Social Distancing Signs](https://pin.it/5xaEap6)"
"Hands, toys, cloths, hair, everything. I tell him not to and take the item away and he doesn’t stop. Is this some type of development display? He has younger siblings, 2 and 5 months.

Fingernails are chewed down to the skin. He will chew his toenails. He’ll sit and chew on the cloth of his pants at his knee and has holes in all his clothes. 

Edited to note that he’s never been diagnosed with any developmental issues and he’s been on track in his development. He’s a very bright and intelligent child. But very sensitive and demanding and prone to tantrums."
"I know that today is a hard day for a lot of people. I am extremely conscious of being careful of what I say on a day like today to my friends and family. I’ve never experienced the loss of a child or the loss of learning that you may never be able to conceive. I have though... raised 2 amazing kids.
Today was a hard day. I helped my youngest move out. The situation is really ideal for her, as she was accepted into the same school as my oldest, which is out of town, and moved in with him.
I hope this is a safe place to say, that I am feeling all the feels, I’m happy for her, and sad for this chapter of my life to close."
"She’s 6 and said she couldn’t get me anything understandably. So she grabbed a blanket when I woke up this morning and cheerfully told me she’d read to me while “daddy makes the breakfast for you!” She told me to lay beside her on the sofa then went “now I tuck you in and read!” and read one fish two fish red fish blue fish  to me. And that was my morning, being read to and getting breakfast haha. I love how children are so ingenious sometimes. Remember to always love what kids gift you even their time because sometimes it’s all they have."
"My fiancée gave birth to our baby last Thursday night. He’s absolutely perfect, and FINALLY slept through the night last night (thank god for rocking Moses baskets and white noise!). The problem is, I have a horrible sinking feeling in my chest and I can’t stop crying. And not in a positive way. I’m not too sure why, but I feel trapped and suddenly everything is about the baby (quite right.) Obviously, I don’t want to just leave my partner to it and go have time to myself, that’s not really fair, but what can I do? Is this normal!"
"I've got 9 kids and only one is alive, all of my losses were 20-30 weeks and I cant bear to look at my kid today because she makes me so uncontrollably sad. My boyfriend hasn't even said happy mothers day to me or acknowledged the child we lost last year (the only one that is his) and even my ex husband texted me asking if I was going to be okay."
"My son's Daddy is incredible. He really is one of those Dad's that goes above and beyond, he lives and breathes for his kids. You need him, he is there in a shot without question, always try to educate and spend quality time together.

My 11 year couldn't care less. He has no interest in anything his Dad has to say and can't be bothered to do anything with him. He loves him, don't get me wrong, but everything is just too much effort for him.

You might say it's his age, coming into puberty but hes been like this for years. 

It just makes me so sad but also angry. He is the Dad everyone dreams of, you know? There are so many kids out there without supportive parents or even without parents full stop and here he is, throwing away his incredible bonding time with his Dad.

I guess that's what happens when you are so privileged, you are just blind to what you have. 

Sorry just needed to rant!!"
"Being stuck at home has been hard and the weather's been cold and rainy (and snowy a few days) which makes her really stuck inside. And she's high energy so that's not easy on her. 

Yesterday it was nice enough so I took her outside to play in our front yard (we live in an apartment complex) and there was no one else out and around so I felt it was okay. She needed to burn off some energy. The neighbor from the next building had her grandson visiting and he came running over to play with her and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. I made sure me and my daughter had our masks on and followed the grandmother's lead as far as determining if she was comfortable with letting them play together. But honestly I wasn't sure what was the right thing to do. She's 6 and the other kid is 4 so they're both pretty young and my kid only has a vague understanding of what's going on right now.

Should I have told them no, they can't play, or brought my kid inside? I'm still trying to figure out if I did the right thing or if I should have separated them. Was wondering what other parents would do or prefer in this kind of situation. And we do have a back yard but it's on a downwards slope and with all the rain we've been getting it's a marshy mud pit at this point so really not a good place to play."
"Hey y’all! My LO is 9 months and nursing with some solids mixed in 1-2 times a day. Prior to COVID he handled bottle feeding when mommy was at work really well. But, mommy has been home and nursing for the last two months and will return to work Friday. Anticipating this, I’ve been attempting to bottle feed the last few days and he’s absolutely refusing. I’ve tried several times to feed him, at different times of day, different locations and positions and with mommy and without mommy. We’re running out of time to get him back on bottles before mommy goes back to work. Any advice, suggestions, tips? Aside of starting to ween?"
"A little setup first: My wife is living in another state gathering experience in a job field so that she may then get a job in a state of our choosing, our ""permanent home state."" We did this separation due to myself being active duty military, soon to be retired. Anyway, main point is she has been away for going on 3 months or so now. She is alone and lonely in a new place. Naturally, her being out of state there isn't a lot the kids can do for her on Mom's Day. 

I feel as though my kids are old enough to know that they need to do SOMETHING for their Mom on Mother's Day. They are 18 and 16 years old. They did nothing. They didn't even call their mother. For the majority of the day I was either video chatting with my wife or on speaker with one another (it's how we spend time together being apart) and they did not utter one word to her. My daughter actually decided to spend the time with her boyfriend's family for 12 hours...she simply sent a text to my wife ""Happy Mother's Day, Mom."" 

I know this upset my wife because she kept casually bringing up that the kids hadn't called her. My wife went to bed about an hour and a half ago, my 16 year old is still sitting on the floor with a VR helmet on and my daughter came home 20 minutes ago with her boyfriend and is spending more time with him.

Now, I am step-dad, so the situation is a bit tricky. If you've ever been in a step-parent position, you know how I'm feeling. I don't want to over-step my bounds, but I am pretty angry and disappointed at them for not even trying. They are not bad kids, they are actually pretty damn great and well-behaved. Not trouble makers in any sense...but still, this bothers me. I think what bothers me the most is knowing my wife is hurting because all she wanted was a call from the kids. 

I guess I'm asking, how do I go about approaching this without losing my temper or sounding like a big ass? Thanks for your time. 

TL:DR - Kid's mom lives out of state, they didn't call her for mother's day. I'm mad about it and she's upset. What do I do?"
"I don’t do change well.  That’s an understatement.  I know that.  I try…a lot and often.  Change that benefits my future is scary. But the change that has come to affect my present is heartbreaking.  Of all the hard days of the COVID-19 quarantine this one was by far the worst- Mother’s Day 2020.

Any other year I would have been in the kitchen cooking for a crowd.  Listening to the chatter closely but from afar was my specialty and most of the time I didn’t mind.  There was a sweet spot for Mother’s Day not that long ago.  A time where my grandmothers were both living and my children were born.  A time when four generations were bustling under one roof.  In those years I proudly took the backseat to the matriarchs.  

My babies are no longer babies. My marriage is no longer in tact. My grandmothers are no longer with us.  Motherhood has taken on a different shape one of which I am not longer familiar or comfortable. Teenagers are hard.  I have become the enemy.   

Today, I sat alone in my once full home.  My girls 17 and 14 went with their Dad to visit his mother who they hardly see.  That left me alone. My only visitor for most of the day was my Mom. I was glad to sit and talk to her after two months of isolation.  However, it just wasn’t the same. Didn’t feel at all like a celebration. 

I will have to wait for grandchildren to ever again see handmade cards, macaroni drawings, or hugs.  Those days are gone.  I miss being called “Mom” without it being huffed, bellowed, or followed by an eyeroll, sigh, or request for money.  I can’t lie, I do miss the hugs and the eye contact.  I miss being treated like anything but a nuisance or as exciting as a pebble in their Nike!

Social distancing would have made the perfect alibi today, but a fallible one.  Honestly I am not sure which was more lonely- actually being alone or the forty five minutes with my mother and daughters where I might as well have been alone.

With no other family to hide behind, the crisis  loudly exposed our brokenness.  Maybe they don’t care, but all I saw was that I was worth less than an hour of my daughters’ time. As soon as my Mom said she was leaving my 17 year old’s keys were in hand to go back to her Dad’s ( I’m the enemy, remember?).

In many ways this was the Mother’s Day that wasn’t in the year that wasn’t.  Did I mention I don’t like change? I know I’m not the only one that’s been here or is here but it feels like I am and social distancing doesn’t help. 

If you have read this far I implore you to check on your friends and family members with teenage daughters…they are not ok."
"So I’ll try to keep this short so it’s not too long but also provide some details. Today my son (3 y/o) told me (25f) that he loves my boyfriend(24m) but sometimes he doesn’t want him to come over. I asked him why and he said “because he’s bad to us”. Now my son is super smart and intuitive so I asked him how he’s bad to us and he basically expressed that my boyfriend upsets me which in turn makes me yell at him or kick him out. It seems like my son doesn’t mind me being protective over us but he genuinely doesn’t like my boyfriend’s frequently bad vibes. He doesn’t like when he yells. He also said when he gets in trouble that I shout at him and that it’s okay if I tell him what to do if he’s being bad but he doesn’t like when my boyfriend tells him what to do. I can respect that because i was the same way as a kid. I only wanted to listen to my mom because i didn’t feel anyone else has the right to discipline me. I’ve been with my boyfriend for just a year and we have a baby on the way. In that year he’s been unfaithful and verbally/physically abusive towards me. Even while pregnant he has abused me once. He has a horrible temper I can admit that. He’s cussed me out in front of my son, has yelled at my son, pushed him down(on accident) and even pinched him. I told him straight don’t put your hands on him &amp; he’s apologized and said he won’t do it again. He says that he loves my son and i believe he does but also think he just doesn’t have the patience to deal with children. My son can be a handful but most kids are, you as the adult should not let it get to you and just brush it off. He just doesn’t get it. It’s been about three months since the last time he was physical with me (on Valentine’s Day I might add). I was 3 months pregnant, i won’t go into much detail on that but it was traumatizing. It always is. This was also the night he pushed my son down. The day after he was super apologetic and saying he wanted to kill himself yada yada. I chose not to break up with him because i wanted my children to have a family and see if we could work it out. I’ve tried to forgive him and move on and have a healthy relationship but I can’t forget all that’s happened In the past year. We had planned to move in together once the baby is born so we can be a family but I can’t help but think that all of his flaws will be amplified once we’re in a space alone “unsupervised”. I’ve just lost all trust for him. I want to believe he’ll do better but I’m not willing to risk me and especially not my children being hurt by him. So I just want to know, what would you do in this situation?"
"Hello!

We're working with our 8 month old boy on crawling. He's super close, he can hold himself up in the seal position but when he starts to try to crawl he just kicks his legs out like he's doing the frog swimming technique. He can't seem to grasp keeping his knees down. Is there anything I can do to help him learn, or is it more of being patient and letting him figure it out on his own?

Thanks!"
"I have a toddler who is just turning two and a three month old. Love them to death but kids are just hard. Between my toddler having tantrums and screaming and my newborn not sleeping and being a newborn - Jesus.

I know this will pass but oh man - sometimes my husband and I want to cry too! Happy Mother’s Day to all!"
"My son it 4. He'll be 5 in six months. He is constantly chewing his toes and fingers. He chews the skin off so there's little bumps and tears in them.
I bought the nasty tasting nail polish and he doesn't care. He won't keep on any shoes or socks. I find myself saying ""don't chew those"" several times an hour.

Any advice?"
FTM raises in an abusive home where I put my parents to bed when they would get drunk and belligerent with each other. They would also abuse my siblings and I for small mishaps as well. I find I can understand their frustration but I want to find a better way to redirect that frustration and learn how to solve the problems differently from what they did with us so I don't damage the relationship I'm building with my 14 month old son. I'm wanting to learn more about Montessori but what books would be good to read? Any other recommendations from anyone who was can relate????
We have been so lax with our 3 and 6 year olds that they think nothing of just quietly walking into our room and into bed an hour or two after we put them to sleep. It’s just programmed into them now. It’s severely hurting our love life! Does anyone have tips on how we can reverse this? Anyone had this issue?
"Kids 4 and 7, the 7 yo has been doing her schooling online and I am concerned about access to unsafe content online. Aside from obviously attempting to be vigilant and checking in on what she is doing, does anyone have any experience with any monitoring programs for amazon fire tablets?"
"I'm so lost I need advice. 

So some info, I'm 18 and my bf is 20. We've been togther for 4 years. We recently came across the scenario that I might be pregnant but we aren't sure yet, I'm going to talk to my doctor later this week. When talking about it my bf expressed some... displeasure to the idea of being a father. We always said I'd go the abortion route but I'm not too sure anymore. He made it very clear he won't stick around and even talked about possibly ending his life if he had to be a father. If I don't have a abortion I have that hanging over my head along with the fact that I'll have to move back home to my chaotic family's house. I don't know what to do, my lifes been going great until now. Any input is greatly appreciated."
"Hi hope you all doing good, This is regarding one of my twin boy. 3 weeks ago, he has started sneezing and couging in the morning 8am to 9:30am, no fever. Then rest of the day he is fine. We called Peditrics and she said might be allergies, suggested Benadryl but didnt help. We again called this week and now medicine changed to Claritin but today is 3rd day and we dont see any effect. In the night, He is sometimes gets up with cold no sneezing but looks like stuffy nose and then go to sleep. 
Due to corona, we didnt take him outside last 8 weeks only in patio sometimes. 
I dont know but I am worried now, am I neglecting something? Anyone faced same situation. Advice, suggestions please .. thank you!!"
"Hi Everyone

I'm not sure if this is just a rant or a request for some clarity (if anyone even has it), but here goes.

My wife and I have a 2 year old daughter. We also live only a half a mile away from my mother who is in her 70s. For obvious reasons we havent gotten close to her for 2 months. And I've been perfectly fine with that decision given what all of the experts have been saying. But lately I've been thinking about how damaging it might be for my daughter to effectively not see her grandma and other kids her age. 

She's just now entering an age where she's much more aware of things and from what I've learned about early childhood development, there are certain critical periods of learning where when you miss out on them it can effect you deeply. For instance if kids dont learn speech at a very particular time they cant ever learn to speak (it's an extreme example I get that, but just to set the table on my logic).

I'm starting to wonder how not seeing her grandmother for many months will effect her ability to have as wholesome and beautiful a relationship as I'd like. And I wonder how not playing with any other kids will effect her ability to socialize in the future. I'm thinking about these things lately because as more news comes out regarding the virus, it seems very likely that this is going to continue for a while. I say this because I keep hearing about fall and winter outbreaks and with the possibility of there being no real solace until a vaccine is out (which could take years if we're being honest).

My mother has had some health issues in the past that concern me. Nothing pertaining to respiratory issues, but certainly shes within the vulnerable population and so that's my primary concern like most of us. But I'm really wondering if the damage to my daughter and frankly to the relationship between her and my mother during her twilight years is worse than the relatively low chance of getting sick.

So I'm in this fork in the road now where I need to make a decision of waiting this out for potentially many more months or just opening our circle further. I'm at an impasse with watching the news. Im convinced that regardless of left or right you are getting information either meant to scare you irrationally or play it off as a non issue. I just wish I had a reliable resource to weigh these things and spit out the most reasonable rational guidance but it's missing for me and probably all of us.

So that's my rant. I'm sure there are other people out there thinking similarly and maybe best case scenario they can get some solace knowing that I'm equally as confused. But maybe someone out there can give me some good feedback on all of this.

TLDR - I'm worried that my 2 year old is not getting the stimulation she needs and that its damaging to her as well as my mother who is not seeing her."
"I just came from the speech therapist, It was our first session.

&amp;#x200B;

She explained how it'll be and what we need to be able to be reimbursed by the national medical care. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my little will have hist first session next week i'll be an evaluation then we'll have a paper that we must have signed by his pediatrician.

Then has to go back for a ear check up, we already did it 2 times and now we have to go again!!

The most shoking an IQ test, i just called and they told me he need to be 3 to be able to take a test. He'll be 3 next month so i took an appointment the day of his birthday... 

&amp;#x200B;

All those cost and time lost, we already lost 2 months because of the lockdown we'll have to wait again to have everything settled before begining his speech therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

But how will they make a IQ test on my son? 

He doesn't have a low IQ but i'm afraid because if the test they'll misjudged him.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading me"
"So this is my second Mother’s day. Last night our 18 mo old daughter developed a high fever, so we’ve been handling that. 

She is the easy part. My husband cannot think about anyone else if it causes him the least discomfort. He is talk and zero action. I don’t get flowers or gifts anymore, even on my birthday. 

Today he developed an attitude late in the day, after I cooked our dinner. I took care of the baby all day- no complaints there- but somehow he was “tired”. She rolled off the couch and hit her head, but refused to tell me anything other than “she’s fine”. He started whining to the baby about how “everything is his fault” and then I about lost it. 

I should not even try to enjoy these holidays anymore."
"I just became a mother to a beautiful, healthy baby girl two weeks ago. Last year, I suffered three miscarriages before becoming pregnant with my daughter in July. Today, Mother’s Day, has special meaning for me, especially considering the mental state I was in last year at this time. 

I woke up this morning, came downstairs, and there was a card on the dining room table for me from my husband. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but that’s all it was - a card that said Happy Mothers Day. He told me that because of the Coronavirus, nothing was open and he couldn’t get me a gift, which is completely untrue. Everything else went on like a normal day, too. I was up all last night with the baby. I ate leftovers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I cleaned up the house, tended to the baby all day while my husband mowed the lawn.

I know many people are probably going to say that I need to talk to him about what my expectations are for Mothers Day, but I kind of don’t see why I should have to do that. Surely he should be able to understand that today is important to me. Right? 

He’s generally a super helpful guy in real life, and we normally have a wonderful relationship with each other. 

I know my emotions are probably still a little off after the birth of our daughter, so I’m a little easier-to-cry right now. Plus, my husband and I haven’t had sex in nine months - he said he felt weird having sex with the baby inside of me, he didn’t want to hurt it, which I understand given our history of miscarriages - but as a consequence I feel a little starved for attention. Also, I still have weight to lose after the baby. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I don’t feel like myself - it would have meant a lot to me to feel appreciated by doing something, anything - that required a little more effort than a card. Am I right to feel this way? Is it justified? What should I do?"
"I’m a single mother of 6 year old twin boys. In line with the current restrictions where I am I did what I could with wishing my mother a Happy Mothers Day and gave her a gift (actually there were a few gifts as there were two group presents for her and a personal gift from my twins and I to her). Then today (day after Mother’s Day) I realised that I wasn’t celebrated at all. Let me explain:

Due to my dad buying a large item (adult children were all chipping in for it) stuff with my mother occurred early (Dad didn’t want to load/unload/hide the item) so my boys were making Mother’s Day cards a week+ ago to give my mum with the gift I had bought her (they love giving their grandparents drawings). But because I had hyped up the fact we were going to be able to see their grandparents for the first time in weeks to give them the pictures they drew I fell to the wayside.

My sister would occasionally try to take the boys shopping for me (I’d give her some money and she’d supervise them picking out a gift for me for Mothers Day/Christmas) but she couldn’t do that this year.

And I realised that this is the first year they are in school to have created something for me that I wouldn’t have known about (the playgroup I took them to until they started kindergarten had parents supervising their own children with a coordinator who had set up various activities but didn’t supervise). 

My boys didn’t know it was Mother’s Day until last night when they questioned why I was making a “special” dinner for myself. (Twins wanted toasted cheese sandwiches, I decided to have eggs and hollandaise sauce on toast) 

Most of my siblings live with my parents so when I went over to give my gift to her/the twins to give her their drawings there were a lot of “Happy Mothers Day, Mum!” being said, along with “hope you like your presents, Mum!” directed at my mother, which is to be expected.

Yesterday on a group chat my nieces half siblings dad (convoluted I know) wished my brother a “Happy Mothers Day/Single Fathers Day”. 

The only “Happy Mothers Day” comment directed towards me was by my mother as I was leaving her house after giving her the gift and pictures. 

Logically I know it’s not my family’s responsibility to wish me a Happy Mothers Day, but I can’t help but feel a little down now thinking that I had subconsciously been a bit excited hearing about what the school does for Mothers/Fathers Day knowing the twins could do something to surprise me this year that I didn’t already know about or had to organise (like in the case of my sister taking the twins shopping, I had to drive them to meet up)."
"Here is the conversation I had with my kids (4 year old twins) today. It was aimed mostly for my son, but I included my daughter as well.

Me: “Can you go to McDonald’s and buy nuggets?

Kids: “yes!”

Me: “can you go to McDonald’s and buy fries?”

Kids: “yes!”

Me: “can you go to McDonald’s and buy boogers?”

Kids: “Ew! No!”

Me: “Well if you can’t go to a restaurant and buy boogers, should we be eating them?”

Kids: “*long pause*.... so are we getting nuggets for lunch or not?”

I give up! I smiled and humored them, but I give up!"
"I’ve been pretty lenient with letting have her phone during quarantine. She can have it with her during the night and do whatever, but I won’t tolerate her talking to her friends in the middle of the night. She isn’t allowed  to text/call her friends after 10pm, god knows what happens when I’m sleeping. I still catch her each night and keep telling her if I find her doing it again, there will be consequences. She doesn’t need to be disturbing her friends late at night and should already be asleep anyways. I don’t want to have to take her phone at night but it seems like the only option. The rule shouldn’t be that hard to follow, and she’ll have the rest of the next day to chat with them."
"I have a 14 year old daughter who recently prefers to sleep on the couch every night despite having her own bed. She used to share a bedroom with her younger (13) sibling for almost all her life but she has pushed to have a room to herself and upon getting it (even before that) she likes to sleep on the couch outside in the living room. I asked what I could do to make her bed more comfortable for her and she said maybe a new blanket she picked out or the fact she let's her imagination run wild, so a less scary room. I gave her all of that and she still prefers the couch. She doesn't fight me when I tell her go to her bed but I have to do it every night and it's a bit annoying. Plus I work night shift and it's at night that I can come out to the living room and not disturb anyone on a console or screen.  I just want her to retire to her room consistently and not have to pry her off the couch to slump to her own bed every night. Any suggestions?"
"My 4 year old daughter has started to, what seems to be, intentionally peeing herself almost daily. I say intentionally as she always laughs and smiles about it and she has been fine for at least a year or two. I just don't get it. 

I don't know what to do about it. Help?"
"It’s my first Mother’s Day and I was so excited! My baby is 7mo old and I love her so very much. I couldn’t wait for family and friends to give me a call or send me a text wishing me a happy Mother’s Day. 

No one has said anything to me. Not even my husband. He didn’t get me a gift, which is no problem. I don’t expect a gift. I did however expect him to say something. Will all of this change once my baby is older? Is there more joy in the holiday once your child can comprehend it? 

Am I making something out of nothing? I feel hurt but I also feel like maybe I’m overreacting."
"Biologically, he’s the exact reason I exist:to propagate people. Looking at my life achievements, recently graduated a vocational college at aaalmost 32, he’s it. He’s the best thing I could have contributed to society and fuck it if I’m not really proud of him and me by extension. He’s smart emotionally at such a young age, he has empathy and he really shows his colors he’s not shy at all, he’s emboldened. He is a bit wary of challenges, but with a little encouraging he is willing to face them. He’s always looking forward to doing things that he wasn’t previously allowed to do that’s a thing for him now he’s about to be 5 and he’s asking what is going to change? What will he now be able to do that he wasn’t “when he was little”? Oof it breaks my heart and equally makes it whole. I consider myself fucking blessed, and I have a whole lifetime of enjoying him before me. Thank you, Life and the Fates, please don’t hit me with a bus or something 

To;dr: I am a happy and proud mom today. My kid is awesome, life isn’t always so awesome but today it is. Give me that."
"I have three children, two different grade levels. Anyone know of any homeschooling websites that make it fun to learn? We are struggling here at my house and I need to find some fun interactive learning tools for when the district assignments aren't cutting it. 

*would be a Plus if any were geared to children with Autism"
My child makes up random stories and tells them to people. The one i specifically remember is that he told a family friend (when he was 6) that in his kindergarten there was a big snake that came into his school and bit a classmate and we even went to her funeral. Thus was after we watched the Anaconda movie. Should i be concerned or is this a normal part of growing up.
"Hi, so my daughters 11th birthday is coming up and we have decided she has earned the privilege of getting a cell phone.  

We have kept her off of all social media, until about a month ago we let her create an Instagram and access it only on my wife’s phone. 

She’s our oldest, and a pretty responsible kid in general, but I am trying to solicit some advice on how to establish boundaries and guidelines on how we can monitor her activity whilst also granting her privacy."
"My two-year-old locked herself in the bathroom today - the only room in the house that has a separate deadbolt for some reason. How she did it is a mystery as no other lock in the house is like that and we haven’t shown her how to do it. So of course, she can’t get out. My husband ended up hammering a screwdriver into the slot to pop the lock back into the unlock position after a few other failed attempts to get it open. Kiddo collapsed in my arms crying for being trapped for a solid 30 minutes. Still don’t know if I’m more frustrated or impressed at my toddler for getting herself in this situation. All my husband had to say about it was “goodbye rental deposit.” Anybody has have random madness this Mother’s Day?"
"Long story short, we were having an argument (one that occurs too regularly, and has never quite come to resolution) about how things get done around the house. I was attempting to make dinner, 5mo was also hungry, husband was online gaming and didn't want to help feed baby until after he was done. I got frustrated and he didn't understand why, while also asking when dinner would be done.
Somehow our sex life got brought up (probably because it's nonexistent) and he said he hasn't touched me in weeks or shown affection because I emasculate him by asking him to help with our baby. Caring for a baby by feeding, bathing, or changing isn't something that comes naturally to men.

Some background - I am a stay at home mom by choice, and I thought I was doing a pretty good job of it, while also showing my husband appreciation for giving me the opportunity to be at home raising our son. He also wanted me to stay home. He works construction, so hard labor most days and is usually exhausted when he gets home. Our routine is that he holds the baby after work and they nap together on the couch so I can do things around the house or, once a week, go grocery shopping. Besides that I am the sole caretaker. But that was something he said he's tired of doing, too. It might sound like I'm being high and mighty, but I swear I can only think of twice in my son's life that I have asked my husband to take over for me so I could do something for myself, and it caused such an argument the last time that I haven't asked since. There was one time in the last month that he offered to take him because I was at a breaking point and in tears. 

He's not a terrible father. He likes to play with our son sometimes and is the best at making him laugh. He'll read a book to him if I ask him to. He's clearing out the garage for a place for them to do things together when our son is older. He keeps saying things will change when our son is older and can listen and understand him. That he'll be a better dad to him then because he can interact with him more. I guess I just worry that the disconnect will be too much to repair once he is old enough, and that all he'll know of his dad is a man who makes money for us to live on.

I guess I just needed to vent to some other parents because I don't want to talk to friends or family about this. I don't want to put him in a bad light to them. I want to look into counseling, but I don't even know if that's something he would agree to. He already told me he won't pay for me to see a therapist for myself, so I can't imagine he'd listen to a marriage counselor."
"Hi guys, so here is the situation. I am soon to be 24 years old and I have just learned that my fiancée is pregnant. I want to know what I should be doing to ensure a smooth transition into this new life. 

The financial aspect of things is under control but I want to know about the rest. 


We bought a house last year.

Our cars are paid off so apart from the mortgage, we have no debt.

I was attending college full time while also working full time but I will be graduating in the coming days. 

I have also saved up about 7 months worth of expenses and my girlfriend has done the same. 

What should I be thinking about? 

I am overwhelmed by this news, I am so happy but it just feels so unreal! Will I be a good dad? Am I too young? 

What advice would you give me? 


Thanks guys!"
"Hi everyone!!  My wife was reading A is for Awesome with our very bright 20 mo daughter tonight, and for the first time, our daughter referred to some black women as “dirty” (as if they needed a bath) and some white women as “clean.”  It wasn’t dirty/gross, just, needed a bath. We are white/Jewish. 

My question is twofold. How can we communicate naturally that people come in a diverse set of colors and that it doesn’t mean anything bad if someone looks different, and if there are any books to teach these concepts. 

Prior to the pandemic, our daughter was in a diverse Montessori day care with a diverse set of teachers, who she loved. But since mid March she hasn’t been exposed to anyone but us. 

Anyone have tips?"
"He has no control over his anger, everytime something doesn't go his way he growls like an animal, screams, stomps away. We have never given in to these tantrums and have consistently given him talks and small punishments like standing in the corner or writing a few lines. The behavior continues.  It doesn't matter if he is enraged or slightly disappointed, everything gets the same reaction and we are at a loss. He is otherwise a sweet, helpful and loving boy with a lot of empathy and sensitivity.  What can we do?"
"Anybody else uncomfortable with other people posting your child on social media? 

I have been asked a few times by extended family and I feel really guilty and awkward but I tell them no, please don’t. I just don’t like the idea that I don’t know everyone who can see it and share it via their page. 

I do post my daughter on my own page because I have a very private friends list and really strict privacy settings. I don’t even have her in my profile photo because that can be seen by public.

Is this an unpopular opinion/am I weird for this? I know they want to share photos of their niece/great granddaughter etc so I do feel really bad saying no, but it just makes me uncomfortable."
"Apologies in advanced since this probably isn’t the right sub, but I couldn’t find one that was active for “Mother’s Day.”

I need help on salvaging today. This is my wife’s first Mother’s Day and I completely dropped the ball. I knew it was coming and all I did was get her matching Mother’s Day shirts with our baby... I was never really big on some of these holidays (mothers/fathers/valentines/etc) so in the back of my mind, today was just whatever. I’ve never even bought her flowers for anything cause I feel like it’s such a waste and she knows how I feel about that too. I got her the shirt and didn’t think anything else of it. We went to my parents house and ate some BBQ that I bought for them and then went home. I noticed that she was annoyed the entire time. Asked her if she was okay and she shrugged it off. I thought she was just tired. We got home and I asked her again what’s wrong? I tried to be playful with her while holding the baby cause the baby was fussy all day and said “Mommy, we’re sorry we were being annoying today!” And to that she responded with “it’s not her I’m mad at. You didn’t even do anything for me today.” I tried to play it off by saying “well with what’s going on with coronavirus, we can’t exactly go out and do anything now can we?” I went to wash the dishes and just kept thinking about it and how I messed up and should’ve tried to do something special for the first time.. any ideas on how to salvage this?"
"I have a hard time sleeping so I'm up and down all night. Well at 2 am I was in my livingroom and it I heard a video. (Everyone else is supposed to be a sleep. 2 kids and husband) I eventually tracked the sound to my 13 yr old son's room. I knocked on the door and opened it and quickly hid his tablet. Now he is not supposed to have this in his room at night. He got really upset when I asked him to remind me what the password was. He claims he has been talking to a mental health worker lately after getting info from school before isolation. He also said he doesn't feel as if he can talk to my husband or I. He said he'd talk to me about it in the morning if I promised not to open his tablet. He was seeing a therapist in grade 4/5 and it helped. 
My question is should I be looking or accepting his wishes and wait to talk to him?
It has me worried about what he has been talking about . I know my husband and I have been fighting a little more frequently due to me not working due to surgery for hystorectomy due to chronic pelvic pain  and weaning off of 4 yrs of narcotics. He still works 8-5 mon-fri and I have bad days and get frustrated with the kids. Due to the pain I have been distant for quite awhile but am working on that.

So do I wait?"
"I don't feel love for my son. When I was pregnant I never had that ""nesting"" phase that most mothers go through. After my son was born he was everything to me. He was my number 1 priority until he was about 8 months  (I was only 18 when I had my son, turned 19 2 months later and was officially legal to party in Canada). I began going on more often while my mother took care of my son. I eventually got a job working odd shifts and she fought in court to take custody since I was working most evenings and overnight shifts. She won. My son is now 7 years old and hasnt lived with me full time since. I stay over at my mother's house with him but it feels like I'm babysitting rather that being his mother. I love him but more as a brother than a son and I hate myself for not being able to love him and be his mom. Fyi my current s.o  wants to get married and have children of his own with me and I want to but I feel guilty. I feel like I love my dog more than my own son. What right do I have to be a mother to more children when I can't feel love for the child I already have 💔"
"My heart is broken today. I work at a grocery store and to keep my little ones safe from getting sick, their grandparents offered to watch them while I worked and figured out what my next step would be with the whole situation. 

Today I called them to say hi, and for them it was any other day. But for me, it was such a special day and I am missing it with them because I want them to be ok. I miss them so much and I feel like a terrible mom."
"Today is Mother's Day. I've been stuck at home (working and raising a 4 year old) for 9 weeks now. My husband is an essential worker so it's just me and my son all day, every day.

I was soooo looking forward to today because I thought I'd be able to sleep in! My husband is an early riser and sometimes on Sundays he'll take our son on a hike, while letting me sleep in. I didn't sleep well all week, getting woken up at 4 or 5 every day. So I really needed to catch up on sleep and have some time alone.

Well... husband got up around 4 as usual, managed to wake me up. I tried to fall back to sleep but around 6 am I heard my son running from his room to mine, and that was it! Husband had gone on a hike alone, and it was just like any regular day, nothing special, no special time off for me.

And now I'm in the wrong because, ""That's life"", as he told me. ""Nothing can be perfect all the time.""

He's only made me breakfast once, in all 8 years we've been together, and that was on my first Mother's Day. It just makes me so sad! Am I asking for too much?? Deep down, I feel I deserve better, but then I think, ""well at least I can count on him to pay the bills on time and he doesn't complain about going to work...."" :("
"I'm just not sure I'm doing this right. Breakfast is pretty set and he usually eats it so that's not a problem, but for lunch I usually make like a sandwich but put it all in different slots on his plate (he's got a special plate, like a tray with 4 slots) so I put, say bread with butter or cream cheese into one slot, ham/cheese in another, some tomatoes/cucumber etc in another slot, a little biscuit or some fruit in the smallest slot. The problem is, he only ever eats the same things. So he always eats the fruit first obviously, then bread, then maybe some tomatoes but rarely eats the protein part. The same with dinner: I dissect it for him and put meat, potatoes/pasta, vegetables all separately but he only ever eats the carbohydrates, never touches the meat/meat replacement and only sometimes has some vegetables. So my question is, is there any point serving him these things every day when he never touched them? Or should I just give up and only give him things he'll eat, maybe try other things when he's older? (he's 2 years 9 months)"
"So for months my 5 yr daughter has been informing us that turtles breath out of their butts.  She heard it from Olaf.  I told her that just because a cartoon says something does not make it true and left it at that.  We watched Frozen 2 last night and she is right, Olaf does say that Turtles breath out of their butts.  So today we looked it up on Google...and i Olaf was telling the truth Turtles do exchange Carbon Dioxide with Oxygen through their butts while they hibernate, 5 yr feels very vindicated right now."
"I’ve always been an athletic guy (football, baseball, basketball) but never played much soccer. Only played one year and our coach wasn’t great. Favored the favorite kids and didn’t teach those who weren’t in the crowd. So I know the basics. The rules, positions, very basic strategy etc. So today my 4 1/2 year old told me he wants to start playing sports. And he is turning out just like me. Extremely competitive. He is already showing signs of being incredibly fast (as was I when younger). So I asked him what sports he wants to try (I would love football as it was always my sport by far, but want to let him explore on his own) and he wants soccer. So me being a very noob at soccer was just gonna YouTube children’s basics, but then I realized... I wouldn’t know if what they are saying and teaching is fundamentally correct. All the coaches at my school were not very great (small school problems) so I had issues that I never knew about. Such as I throw extremely hard, yet been having very bad fundamentals my entire life since I was never taught I was doing it wrong. Which has led to ligament damage for myself. So basically I want to make sure what I instill in him, is the right things. What to emphasize and what to look for. 

TLDR: I don’t know soccer well, so I want to know of any videos that any soccer buffs agree with being great on children fundamentals for long term health and skill."
"My 9mo boy sleeps for 12 hours each night (with a dream feed) and nap for 2-3 hours total. That leaves 9 hours that he’s awake. Everything I’ve read says he should be getting 4-5 bottles a day and 3 solids. That works out to almost a meal an hour. He never seems super hungry and only takes at most 4oz of formula and an ounce of solid if he feels like it. 

We have a checkup for him coming up soon so I’ll ask my PED but just want to see if anyone has experience or advice to share."
"I told myself I was going to ""avoid saying no"" with my kids for a change. If they ask to play a game, do a craft, or go somewhere I was going to ask myself ""why not"" and not let my own laziness hold them or myself back.

My goodness, every time we do something, I'm reminded of why I wasn't doing this before . There's always someone who doesn't want to and fighting as we're getting ready (though that changes once we actually start), then complaining when it's over, and then cleaning up afterwards!

I don't know how the other parents I see constantly posting stuff do it without going crazy."
"Hello Everyone

I had a bad day, and need somewhere to type it out. My wife has a demanding career where she works usually 90+ hours per week. I work from home and for the most part am the breadwinner. Being the person at home is mostly not so bad, but as our baby continues to grow (3.5 months) I’m finding less and less time to do things for my own personal enjoyment and professional necessity. Today I had no more than 10-15 minutes of time where I didn’t have to give my son at least partial attention. 

We have a nanny that is here 6 hours a day Monday through Friday, and then I take over for the remainder of my work day. We can barely afford to have the nanny here for that schedule let alone having her here longer. We’d love to have relatives over to help, but covid isn’t really allowing it. 

My son used to sleep or relax more, but now he almost always requires semi or fully focused attention, which means I cannot usually finish my work or even get any exercise during the day. I am at a point where my happiness with this child is less than the stress I have related to raising him.

We do not have him on a sleep schedule outside of him going in the snoo at 8pm (with usually 1-2 wake ups after about 6 hours). During the day I’ve had difficulty finding a good way of setting up a sleep schedule. He seems to always be awake and wanting to hang out. Any advice on implementing a nap schedule where I can exercise, read or just enjoy time to myself? 

I am at my wits end. Any advice is so overly welcomed."
"Throwaway account, also english isn't my first language

My (42F) daughter (13F) has been quietly crying in her room every night for a week now. I've asked her what's wrong and I always gotten answers like 'You would get mad' or 'I don't want to make you sad' and i'm very worried but also very upset that she doesn't trust me enough to share her troubles with me. I like to believe that i'm a good parent and that I can help my daughter but she really doesn't want to say anything about it. I've told her that I wouldn't get mad but she still refuses, we normally get along fine and this has only happened recently, any help would be appreciated."
"My wife and I have a newly 14 year old son/stepson. He wants to make some $$ and I was wondering what you all make your teenagers do and how much you pay them or what do you make them do for an allowance and how much do you give them? Also, do you give them cash, put straight into a bank account or use things like Venmo? Thanks for all of the advice!"
"A little background. I live in the Kaiserslautern area of Germany with my wife and two daughters, 15 and 14. My 15 yo has had a hard time making friends in the area. I am looking to learn what other parents in this situation may have used as a way to introduce their kid to new friends. The main barrier right now is language since we are Americans here on an assignment. I appreciate any advice."
"Hey all, first time posting here.... I apologize for the lengthy post. TLDR down at the bottom.

   I have gotten *some* advice from my own therapist, and also look forward to getting advice from my son's (relatively new) therapist. However, I wanted to outsource this question and get some more help from a larger group. Maybe some of you will have been in this situation before.  


   I (28M) have a son who is almost 6 years old. Mother and I have been apart since just before his first birthday, so a split home is normal for him. (We both had joint legal custody since 2016).  
  

   The last 5 years has been absolute hell on Earth. I try my hardest to shield and hide the issues surrounding his mother and I, but I am not always able to. I cannot erase his memories of his mother beating on me, and I cannot take-back the time when his mother explained what a restraining order is, and why Mommy can't come near Daddy.... or why Daddy ""keeps throwing Mommy in jail"". I have tried my hardest to keep the literal **constant** litigation out of his world.  


   Just before the holidays last year, my child disappeared from school and was not seen for 2 weeks. To make a long and miserable story short, Mother decided to take our child, flee out of state, file for custody in a different state (without jurisdiction), and started planning to flee the country and kidnap our child, never to be seen again.  
 Why would Mother do this? She has developed some serious mental health issues and has fallen delusional that the government is ""out to kill her"" and the courts are ""corrupt"" and numerous 3-letter agencies are conspiring to sell our son into a human trafficking ring.  
  

   After the 9th day of our son being missing, I worked with 5 police departments to track him down. He was found - safe - with his Mother and Step Father. After the police got involved, Mother brought him back and returned to Home State. Once he was returned, information was provided to me through various law enforcement agencies about the plans to flee the country with our child. I immediately moved for emergency custody, and our son has been living with me for 5 months now.  
  

   Mother was restricted to supervised visitation for 4 hours a week. This of course was a huge change for the little guy, and he naturally asked questions such as ""Why can't I go back to Mommy's house?"" or asking (in his own words) why he could only see Mommy at that [supervised center]? These were some really tough questions to answer. I had to walk a fine line, because I did not want to have to explain what is really going on. I refuse to openly disparage his mother in front of him, or speak ill about her in any way, shape or form. I also have been told many times, to not lie to him..... So, I would tell him half-truths. I would go on to tell him that ""Mommy just needs some help right now, and needs time to get some things sorted out. So you're going to come live with me for awhile so she can get some things like (school) and (work) done.""  
  

   Well eventually, after only a few visits, his Mother stopped showing up all together to come visit him at the supervised center. The first 2 times, I got there and the staff told me she wasn't there yet and she hadn't called to explain where she was. So they cancelled the visits. Seeing the look on my son's face when we drove all the way up there to see Mommy, only to be told she hadn't come, broke my heart. He was so sad and confused and cried and cried.  
  

   *I lied for her.* Despite letting our son down, I lied to our child to make it look like she wasn't a bad guy. I told him the first time, that Mommy must be having some car trouble and she is having a bad day. The second time, it was really snowy out so I told him that Mommy wasn't able to make it because the weather outside. And that is is dangerous, and it's a good thing that Mommy stays home and is safe, because Mommy might get into a car accident or stuck in the snow.  
  

   Soon after, she just stopped coming all together and the center cancelled all visits. On the third and final no-show, I was so angry at her. I decided not to cover for her. Our son realized Mommy cancelled and didn't come to see him, and I didn't have it in me to lie for her any more. He cried and went on to say he ""doesn't think Mommy wants to see him anymore."" I held him tight and broke down like a baby. I could feel his pain, and I was so saddened to know that deep down in his heart, he felt like she no longer cared about him.  
  

   That was 3 months ago. She fled the state to avoid getting arrested on a warrant. Since then, when he asks about his mother, I tell him that ""Mommy loves him very much and misses him every day. And that she is taking care of things back in her home state and will return someday, hopefully soon.""  
  

   Earlier this week, I was granted sole physical and legal custody of our son. I also learned that Mother was finally apprehended on her warrants after she started sending death threats to me, her mother, the detectives on the case, and many others. I cannot begin to express the feelings I hold inside.... I am immensely happy, I am relieved, stressed out from fighting, and tired. I look forward to a brighter future.  
  

   However, I am stuck. I have won full custody of our child, and I don't know how to even begin to explain this to him. I eventually have to discuss the changes with him, and why he will be living with me from here on out. His mother is likely to be extradited back to our home state, and stand trial for a felony charge (among other charges). She may go to jail for quite some time..... Do I explain to him that his Mother is in jail? In the past, I avoided telling him about her being in jail because it was only a few days and I didn't think he needed to be aware of that. But now, she may be sentenced to do some time and may go away for a few months.  
  

   I'm at a loss and I am in over my head. I know that I *have* to start giving him explanations, but I don't want him to think his mother is bad person. (I mean, she is a massive piece of shit to me, but her relationship with him was always strong and warm. She just screwed up alot by trying to put our child in the middle of everything and trying to turn him against me). I don't know what to do anymore or what to tell him. I need some help from some of you.   
  

TLDR: Mom lost custody after trying to kidnap the kid and flee the country. Mom loves kid, kid loves Mom. Need help explaining the changes to kiddo's life without making Mom out to be a monster."
"My baby is 4 months old in about 10 days. She will sleep just fine in my arms etc.

Whenever we put her in the bassinet to sleep,  we have to swaddle her up. She just will not sleep unless she is swaddled. Is this normal and is this okay?"
My 10.5 month old has recently become clingy to me and extra fussy around grandparents etc. it’s new behavior (she is also cutting a tooth and starting to walk). Is this normal and a phase? How do I get her to be comfortable with other family members again?
"When they rudely don’t listen like they almost got their hands over their ears! Can anyone tell me from their experience looking back, when the little subtle changes towards teenager-hood start to happen please? I often think ‘is this the beginning, or is he just tired, or is he just plain rude?’!!!

Cheers in advance,

Becky, single mum of one."
"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any good suggestions for shows, videos, or apps for children to learn, or least not be harmful(violent, rude etc)...my kids are 5 and 7 and we have access to YouTube, Netflix and the internet. 
Also music, music is big for my 7 year old, he loves popular music and hip hop music and really every kind, but a lot of it has negative messages.
Thank you!!!"
"So I’ve been in my step kids life for the last 5 years. She knows I call her my daughter when I talk about her with my friends and coworkers and she was happy to hear that. I don’t expect to be called mom or step mom or anything like that. But something my partner at work yesterday had me bawling and now as I write about it, it’s making me cry. As we were leaving work he told me ‘Have a happy Mother’s Day.’

So many conflicting feelings. First, sweetest thing ever. Second, saddened that someone who has a kid, and a wife who is also a step mom to that kid, sees all the work that I do, and gave me some recognition that I don’t feel like I get from my own family and thus makes me incredibly saddened. 

I haven’t had a mom since I was 12. So I feel like I’m missing out on all the things as a daughter I wanted to do with my mom. One of my goals in life is to be a better parent than mine we’re and to get to do those things with my own kid someday. So Mother’s Day really sucks, and I’m probably projecting all my feelings on to this.

Update: While I was asking her if I could refer to her as my daughter, she’d asked me why I never gave up on her. She and I had a horrible relationship when her dad and I first got together. I told her because I loved her and she was a critical person in my life, and that because of that love of never stop trying to make things work between us. 

Whelp all of that must have paid off. She came up to me just now and told me ‘It just occurred to me, you’re like my mother and I haven’t wished you Happy Mother’s Day yet.’ 

I’m now bawling like a baby. I have the sweetest and best kid ever. Step parenting is heart breaking, aggravating, and sometimes devastating. But when it goes right, the love and affection you receive from a kid who accepts you as a parent, the love and bond you’ve built is the most rewarding thing ever. I think my life is complete now. 

Keep up the hard work step parents. Happy Mother’s Day to those of you who have put in that time and effort to be a parent to your kiddos. Just because you’re not a bio parent doesn’t mean you’re not just as important. 💜"
"That's how long my child (3) can keep a secret.

While mommy was asleep, we sat down in the kitchen floor and made her a mother's day card.

""Shh. It's a secret. We're gonna give it to mommy tomorrow.""

""Okay. I'll hide it under my bed so she wont find it.""

Mommy wakes up at 8 on the dot.

""Mommy mommy! I have a secret and I can't tell you.""

10:13 Mommy and daddy are doing laundry in the master bedroom.

In walks my daughter with the card she fished out from under her bed."
"My wife and I had our first baby just seven months and three days ago. My wife is a stay at home mom and I work my gd butt off to take care of those two. The end of March, my boss sent everyone home because of the virus. I was out for a full month. Boss called last week and said it was time to come back to work. The last week has been so brutally hard after spending an entire month with my son from sun up to son down. Now I come home from work and maybe have three maybe four hours with him to play, read, feed him his dinner and put him down to sleep for the night. Just like before the virus. But I am just so much more painfully aware of what I’m missing out on. It’s not enough time with him. It’s depressing it honestly hurts.

I was lucky that my boss continued to pay me through our shutdown. I did not have to worry about finances. If anything, financially, it was probably our best month in a very long time. Staying in, cooking every meal, no coffee stops etc. Just me and my little friend. Living and laughing and learning and playing. I’m really struggling this week. The baby is really struggling this week. His mama FaceTimes me as often as my work schedule will allow, so not often. But I guess he’s been fussy and crying and screaming. Until of course he hears me on the phone or sees me on the screen. For a few minutes and then when I hang up he’s miserable again. 

It’s been a tough week. I hate myself for thinking i wish the virus has been a tad bit worse so I’d be staying home longer...I know that’s horrible, I apologize. I’m so sorry I said that...I didn’t realize this would be the hardest part for me. 

I live just outside of Boston. I own my home just over 50%. I’m considering quitting my job and selling my home. I could move to the middle of nowhere and buy a nice home outright and still have enough money left over to live minimally for a few years. That way I could be at home with him every day. Maybe take online courses so that I have a better job to go back to once he is a little older...I know that’s probably a horrible idea...

Just ranting...anyone else?"
"Recently, my 6yr old son has kinda regressed in his toilet use. He first started peeing in the tub, we told him not to do that and only pee in the toilet. Then he peed in a bucket I used for handwashing clothes, we did the same thing and made him clean it up. He then peed in the bathroom trashcan. Now were getting frustrated and making him clean it and taking things away. He comes up with some dumb reasons he does this and lies the first few times we ask. Today he peed without lifting the toilet seat getting it all over the place. His reason was he saw poop on the toilet seat (there was none) then he said the seat wouldn't stay open, so my husband thinks hes just getting lazy and peeing however he wants.  I need this behavior to stop. 

He's super sensitive and if he thinks hes in trouble he immediately shuts down and cries. We know this is connected to a medical condition he has but jesus, he was fine up until school let out. I know it has something to do with that but we havent broken routine here and hes just getting worst and lying."
"It’s my first Mother’s Day. She was being cute (in my eyes) and having a little fake tantrum because I wouldn’t let her play with the breast pump cables while I was pumping.
She’s 10 months and standing on her own, learning to have fits, etc, so it’s new to me and endearing. I can’t help but laugh when I say “no!” and she does whatever she wants anyways! I’m sure that will wear off soon.

Anyways.

I took my phone out to record her cuteness, while trying to shoo her away from the cables.

Well. I shooed her away and she lost balance. She conked her head against the windowsill and cried for several minutes with an extremely high pitched scream.

If I hadn’t been trying to record her I don’t think it would have happened. Now I feel ultra guilty for hurting my kid on the day that’s supposed to celebrate what a “wonderful” mom I am!

In other words, now I feel like I don’t deserve to be celebrated. 

I’m sure I’m being dramatic, but for whatever reason, every small thing that happens to her affects me in a very big way. The last time she got hurt because of me was a few months ago and I’m still not over that. I honestly think I never will be.

How do you guys cope with mom/dad guilt?

TLDR: I caused a minor accident on my first Mother’s Day and now I am filled with illogical self-loathing that I can’t seem to control :’)"
"My 10 year old son did a naughty thing in an attempt to get another kid in trouble. I had a hunch it was him, but he denied it, so I ended up telling him that I had gotten the fingerprint results back and was there anything he wanted to tell me. He confessed and consequences were had, but now I'm feeling really crappy. I hate that he did it in the first place, I hate that I couldn't get him to come clean, and I hate that I lied. I'm sitting here on mother's day feeling like a pretty terrible mother."
"This week my 11 month olds new tricks include climbing the couch and breathing out of his nose weird when he is breastfeeding or excited. Nothing is in his nose, we’ve checked the best way I could explain the noise he makes with his nose is when our dog is heavily sniffing something so our roommates think that’s where he learned it from. Anyone else’s kids mimic family pets?"
"Hello fellow redditors, and Happy Mothers Day to all!

So this morning, our 5-year old daughter said some hurtful things to my wife. They were playing together, and my daughter wanted to sing a song, but when my wife said she wanted to join in, my daughter told her, ""You're not a cool / amazing person, I don't want to sing with you."" And my wife exploded at her, and told her that she didn't like her, said some other disparaging things. Our daughter was very upset by these things, and slammed the door and came out crying.

I didn't hear the actual exchange, mind you (I was in another room) and I only heard a door slam from two floors down. I investigated, and found my daughter sitting at the top of the stairs with tears in her eyes. I asked her what happened, and she said that mom told her that she hated her. So I asked, what happened, and the little one wasn't willing to talk about it. So I decided that we should have the conversation later on, once everyone was calmed down.

My wife later came storming downstairs, in a really bad mood. I didn't think it would be helpful to open things up for discussion while tempers were still hot, so I decided to just go along with the normal routine. I tried to lighten the mood by suggesting I make something delicious for her, which she responded calmly to. 

Daughter and I then went downstairs to do a quick facetime with grandma to wish her Happy Mothers Day as well. Then came back up. Wife then exploded at both of us, saying that if she was going to be so disrespected, what was the point of her even being here, etc. And just going on a tirade.

So I sat down with daughter to get the whole truth about what happened. Took the calm, reasonable approach. Wife is sitting there interjecting herself into the conversation, yelling, going off. I asked her to stop, that this was not helping, but wife would not calm down and started to yell at me as well, telling me that the way I was handling things was wrong, and trying to forcefully make me agree with her. I told her that I was not going to have a conversation about parenting styles until everything was calmed down and we could discuss things like adults.

Wife then continued to disparage the way I was handling things in a loud voice, so I eventually just left the conversation because I didn't think it was helpful to disciplining our daughter to be having a screaming match in front of her. She kept saying we needed to force my daughter to apologize right then and there, and she also kept saying that I was complicit in my daughter's bad behavior by not punishing her on the spot in a big way. And she continued to try to lecture by yelling at me about it, so eventually I had enough and decided to walk out. I stayed calm throughout. 

So, anyway, I'm wondering how you all would suggest handling these kinds of situations. In my opinion, doing anything like that in the heat of the moment is not productive, as all it shows to our kid is that her parents, adults, handle things by lashing out and yelling at each other. 

But I am honestly curious about how others think. I know I'm pretty laid back when it comes to parenting, but was I wrong to handle things this way? How would you suggest handling situations like this?

Thank you."
"Have you ever wondered why someone acts the way they do... then you realise there is an actual medical term for it. 

Little prince syndrome means a grown man acts like a child. This is usually brought on by an I’ve protective mother or a mentally unstable childhood. 

We have two young girls one only a very small baby, the other just starting out at school. But I feel like I also have a 10 year old I am raising.

He acts like a child when he is playing with our eldest, he will refuse to do anything that is responsible when I ask, if I ask him to keep the noise done for the sleeping baby he will become louder. He is needy and fidgety, May I add he also has ADHD.

Some days I feel like I’m living a nightmare. Why am I with someone that gives me anxiety daily. Why do I try to rely on someone that mentally can not be there to do anything responsible. 

The attention always needs to be on him, he needs praise all the time. 

I am exhausted."
"Sorry for the way this post looks, im on mobile.
I’m 18, and i just had my first baby. He was an emergency c section, i was getting monitored when his heart dropped during a contraction and they decided to deliver him. he was 3 weeks early. It was the hardest thing ive ever done but it was so worth it. my pregnancy was high risk because i am bipolar and was on some heavy medication which is the reason for the monitoring. I love my baby so much, everything has been going good at home, my boyfriend is doing good (hes just really stressed and worried lol) but my baby boy has jaundice, and we were going to get a biliblanket but my insurance wont cover it. so he had to be admitted back into the hospital for phototherapy. i know its just jaundice and he’ll be okay but this is so hard. i love him so much it hurts i keep crying and crying and i just want him to be better and come home. i hate my stupid fucking insurance its so stupid my baby doesnt deserve this. i really never felt this unconditional love until he was born. my mental illness kicks my ass but  he makes me strong. i do it for him. my PPD is setting in and im very emotional but im staying strong. i want to help him and provide him with a good life, i never want him to feel the pain of having shitty parents like me. im young i know, but i know i can do it, i know HE can do it. im just emotional and needed to vent. i love my little boy so much."
"I'm going back to work 12 hour days. My baby is on a good schedule. I am able to sleep at night and she barely cries because she knows what to expect. I think it makes the day of whoever is caring for her easier. They now know when she eats, naps, and playtime. My husband thinks it is impossible to live up to the schedule's standards. So is it crazy for me to expect them to look at times on a sheet of paper and follow it?? Is it rude?"
"I just want to ask every moms if you guys agree with me or not. I'm very stressed over mother in-law that she is very obsessed with my 4 months old son. I understand that she love him so much but she always texts and calls to bring him to her house everyday. My husband, myself and parents in law aren't working at the moment because of COVID 19. Her obsession is getting worse.. 

She was happy to have grandchild when I was pregnant and she was buying all kinds of stuff for him which I really appreciate what she did for us and him. But it got so much that she even wanted to come into the delivery room which I said yes for my husband.. I was regretting it but oh well. Doctors and Nurses asked me if i wanted anyone to go out or stay outside of curtain while they were checking on me and I just looked at my mother in law and said nothing.. didn't want to be rude but thankfully nurses and doctors noticed that I didn't want her to look at me when they were checking so they closed curtains on her. And during labor which I had for 36hrs labor for my baby and she was commenting on FB as well to her friends how many cm was opened... i was so mad that she is sharing every single thing about my child birth. 

When I finally had my son, she stayed and watched me breastfeeding... I wasn't happy and she stayed almost all night after child birth and not leaving my baby alone with me and my husband. I was discharged the day after and she came over the next day with father in law at night around 10pm with beer and turned up the music(punk rock) so loud. I couldnt sit or stand because i was in so much in pain. My mom was worried because I was so stressed and lost so much weight after all that. My mother in law came almost every week to see him and I was still in pain.. I told my husband I don't want anyone in the house until I recover and my son is used to the new world. He agreed and he told his mom that I wouldnt want anyone... and even they come over, it will be before 6pm, no alcohol and no music!!! I heard she was crying because she wanted to see my son... I felt bad and she was making me a bad person and my brother in law was accusing me saying ""what did you do to my mom"". I was furious and I told them no more coming over until I said so!!

Few months later, she was asking more and more to bring him to her house and we did sometimes. COVID19 started and still she wants him out there to her house even when it was raining so hard. I asked her to come over instead and she said no because father in law is allergic to dogs..and we had a pug. She refused to come over and she said if we dont bring him to her house, she won't watch him for us while we go buy his food abs grocery shopping.. I had no choice to bring him to her house... and found out she gave him a bath without letting me know and she had NO towels, bath shampoo and lotion! Which I won't accept because I use separate towels only for him and his legs are dry so he needs lotion too...

My mother in law keeps trying to buy for my son which I appreciate but I want to buy him, not her. And things she buys for him is all about her and what she likes... not asking opinions and she does whatever she wants to do. She never let me hold him, change him or feed him when we are together and she even asked my husband to bring my baby over to her house and tell us to go shopping... 

I don't think she knows her place to be and give us space. She is all over to our family life and does not want to back up.. she even chewed on my baby's nails when he was a month old saying ""I chewed my son's nails when I had them"". I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU DID BACK IN YOUR TIME and she doesn't respect me to be a mother and it always have to be her way or else she will cry or not talk to me at all. 

I talked to my husband and he doesn't understand why I feel this way over my son... am I over reacting or do your mother in laws same as mine...? She makes me feel like she controls him and want to take him away from me... 

What should I do???"
"My daughter has been going to the same Pre-k since she was 2. Her teachers are like family to us. She will be 5 in June so she will have to start kindergarten at a new school in the fall

I have had her home and out of daycare since 3/12. I’m a teacher myself and working from home currently so it’s not a big deal to keep her with me. Her daycare is reopening next week and asked if she’d be going back, but at this point I’ll be home until at least August when school starts up again

I feel bad that my daughter could never go back to her daycare again, but I also don’t think it’s a wise decision since I’m home anyway

Thoughts?"
"My poor LO has broken her leg and in a cast from upper thigh to toes. She’s nearly 10mo and was crawling/ pulling up/ cruising. As her pain subsides, I know she is going to get frustrated by lack of movement. Any tips/ activity suggestions for me or shared experiences for reassurance!? Currently she’s still feeling poorly so cuddles and books are keeping her happy thankfully."
"Today is my daughter's birthday. Seems like only yesterday that she was my fiesty little girl who was begging for a Baby Alive doll for her birthday. Now she's a strong willed, confident, and compassionate 15 year old who begged for jeans with rips in them and makeup brushes for her birthday. 


She's fifteen today. While I am very proud of the young lady she's becoming, I'm still scared for what's to come. I think I'll be drinking a lot through these next few years. 😳 Send help."
"7 years ago I gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl, I was 17 at the time. 
My mom helped me with everything, but about 2 months after she was born I had a mental breakdown and told my mom I wanted to give her up for adoption. 
Because I was underage we got a third party to be her legal guardian who would give us advice and offer guidance where needed. She came and talked with me about how adoption could influence children and how staying with bio-parents would almost always be the best option.

I won't go into detail about everything that happend the next few years but my mom practically raised her from then on. 
There were times where I saw her twice every week but also times when I hadn't seen her for a month. 

When she was around 5 and she began to have play dates, and she was confronted with the fact that her home situation was different from the other kids, she began asking all kinds of questions about why she couldn't live with me and why I couldn't raise her ect. 

I've always tried to explain to her that I'm sick and it's in my brain and it has nothing to do with her, but I don't even fully understand it myself. 
I just can't and it hurts so much because I know it breaks her heart every time I leave after a visit. 

She even offered me money once so I would stay longer, like, what the hell am I supposed to say to that?

She has a very stable home living with my mom, stepdad and my little sister, she has a healthy relationship with her father and is with him 3 weekends of the month.

I just feel like her life would be less confusing/difficult if I wasn't there. 
I love her so much but I feel like I'm just hurting her by not being able to be there for her. 

About 6 months ago I had a pretty serious suicide attempt, I know she loves me, and it would destroy her if I died but I can't help to worry about the future.
Maybe it's better to leave while she still has happy memories of me, than give myself the opportunity to destroy even that.


Edit: First of all I want to thank everyone who took the time to read my post and commented to share their story or give some advice.

I hadn't been feeling very well and with mothersday coming up I was just very conflicted with myself. 

I'm happy to let you all know i have gotten back in contact with my therapist and got myself an appointment in a few days.

I just needed some perspective, that what I'm feeling right now isn't permanent. 
I'll continue to strive for improvement
And I'll continue to do the best that I can in the meantime."

Hi all, want to see if I can get some opinions on what might be going on with my baby girl. She is 2.5 and I have a 3 month old. At first she was very sweet w her little sister, she would bring her toys and blankets, ask to hug and dance w her, it was adorable. We’ve been taking quarantine pretty seriously and she hasn’t been to her daycare or any social activities in weeks. 

Within the last week husband I have started to get worried. She shows no interest in her sister, doesn’t really respond to her name, bad eye contact (she still will just not when you ask or try to get her to). I used to be able to ask about her day and what we did, she would say go to park or whatever it was. Now, if she’s eating or busy it’s like she’s in her own world, she’ll look around or laugh at seemingly nothing. She’ll run around the room in circles laughing (just being silly?). She makes more none sense noises and she’s always been a great talker.

I’m worried she is on the spectrum, though she does seem to understand emotion. She loves her nephews but isn’t showing interest anymore when we FaceTime. She didn’t show interest in other kids at school (she was terrible at participating in group things). She does show concern when babies cry, so I know she understands emotion and she’s great with imaginative play and she’ll say things like are you okay? Or oh no! to her cartoons. So it could be more ADD. I can’t take her into the doctor bc they are only seeing little babies, I do have an appointment next week with my little one so I can ask then, just wanted to see if anyone else has seen a regression either because of adding a new child or this damn quarantine. She’s always been fiercely independent, but I just don’t feel like she’s my sweet girl anymore and I’m worried sick."
"I am a single mom of a 6 year old boy. I thought that I got used to the way every Mother’s Day is “celebrated”, or rather not celebrated in my family of two. I find it very surprising and sad that today on Mother’s Day I got sad that my son didn’t wish me a happy Mother’s Day, for once that I just told him yesterday about it, and even after telling him about that day, he still didn’t say anything special, like that he loves me. He said that it’s just a regular day, and that there is no reason to celebrate such a stupid day.
I don’t know how other children know about the Mother’s Day. Maybe they know it from school or their fathers or other family members. But today, with schools closed, and no one making me even a silly card or something, it makes me very sad."
"Hi all, young single dad (22) here. I’m new to the whole parenting gig and although my son is only 4 months old and I’m in the process of getting joint custody (the separation and divorce was fairly recently), I wanted to ask at what age is appropriate to start taking him out with me? 

Coronavirus aside, when is an appropriate age to take him to lunch with me and some friends. I want him to have a close bond with me and his uncles (my friends) and family. Or on a trip to the shopping centre. Or even to watch a movie; as the cinemas near me all have kids showings specifically for parents and children. I have every intention of taking care of my son and playing an active role in his life.
And what things can I do with him to stimulate his learning? Like baby parent play groups or anything like that

Any help would be appreciated!!"
"I am a father of a 7-month old. Like all the good fathers out there, I read a lot about how babies work, what to do with them and how to give them the best care I can. 

One of the many things I learnt while preparing for the little ones arrival:

No child under the age of 2 years old should watch TV. It may cause a lot of damage. Behavioural, social, psychological, you name it. Problems. It may also affect hearing and sight. 

I didn't like that. I searched for alternative opinions. Couldn't find anything from a good source. So my SO and I decided: no TV for our child, until he turns 2.

Fast forward 10-or-so months ahead and the situation is as follows:

Our baby is teething. He cries. He needs a lot of contact. Naps are practically gone: 1,5 hours a day these days. With work and commute, I am gone 10 hours a day. My wife is losing her mind.

So I come home one day and there he is, watching toddler cartoons. Calm. I ask my wife about it, she says that all of her mom friends let their kids watch TV. I ask her if this is necessary, since we know the possible consiquences. She says I don't know what it's like to be at home with a little baby all day, and that weekends doesn't count becouse then there's two of us taking care of him. I agree, but we still don't think TV is even remotely good option in a situation like this.

So my question goes as follows: are the harms caused by TV exaggerated, or should we continue this no-TV rule of ours? One of her friends said that all these studies are practically the same as if someone would say that smoking even a one cigarette could kill you.

I know TV makes their days really, really much easier, but we both feel wrong about letting him watch those cartoons."
"My wife and I are at the end of our mental ropes when it comes to bedtime shenanigans. It started with our son(3.5). He has been a bear to get to sleep since day one but has recently gotten to the point where he screams and cries for an hour or more, regardless of being alone or accompanied by myself or my wife. Now, our daughter(2) joins in on the ""fun"". As I type this I just took my daughter from the wife after sneaking out of my sons room and am now figuratively bleeding from the ears. Tried all the normal meds for pain from teeth or growing and tried the grandmas remedies we're comfortable with... we need advice from anyone that is in our shoes or has been where we are, please..."
"My 2.5 year old properly spelled and wrote ""mom"" on a card for me and I'm smitten! He does (by choice) a dry erase letter book and I've only ever given him instruction when he asks and it looks like it's really sticking! I've spent a lot of time at work this week prepping for mother's day and it's so relieving to know I'm doing ok in some way."
"So, last night, my 15 yr old daughter decided it would be a good idea for her and her best friend to sneak out the front door in the middle of the night. Obviously they got busted. Friend was sent home and the wife and i told her we would talk about this tomorrow. 

I'm struggling pretty hard with the right balance of discipline here. I need her to know that this type of behavior isn't acceptable, but also that this isn't a super major offense but shouldn't to happen again.
 
I'm thinking of putting some of it back on her by asking her what she thinks might be appropriate consequences. Hoping maybe it gets the mind spinning and she understands this isn't ok.

Trying not to end up on r/insaneparents.  😁

Thoughts from other parents who have dealt with this before would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks!"
"Interested in your thoughts on this... my son scraped his knee, level 6 out of 10: no broken bones, or tears, but blood and two deep cuts non of which soaked through bandages.  He cried loudly, overheated his body, continued this way for quite some time and I become concerned about his stress level vs the bumps and cuts he received.  

My thought was to be calm, hug, hold, and comfort him, that after a reasonable period of time of 15-20min the crying should be reduced with distractions like, tell me about that toy again?, or what can I bring you that will make you feel better? 

My wife disagrees, would rather sit and hold for a hour if possible, to let him cry it out.  

I’m not a macho, sports dad who thinks his boy is a sissy for crying..I own more pink clothes than my wife, but when I see my boy mentally stressed over something that he can manage then I feel it’s my role to try and lesson the situation.  

Any all feedback is welcome."
"Hey parents 

Happy Mother’s Day!! 

So my kiddo is going to be crawling anytime soon and I feel dumb in this category. I know I need to baby proof my home by covering the outlets and making sure nothing falls on him but what else do I need to baby proof? 

Any links, suggestions and advices are greatly appreciated!"
"
I have two children, ages 8 and 11. Of course I love them dearly. However, something inside me says I’m not done. I’d like to have one (or maybe two more). I have a good income and could afford to have more children. I have a good relationship with my spouse. However, I don’t know if I want to start all over with a baby especially since my youngest is about to turn 9. Also, my age is a consideration-I just turned 40. Has anyone else done this? Was your experience positive? Any regrets?"
"Our kid is 18 mo and he LOVES his bottle. Not just before bed but anytime he’s drinking milk. He won’t drink milk unless it’s out of a bottle. Idk what gives but I’m
Hoping y’all have some tips for weaning him off it? I’m more of a cold turkey kind of quitter, the wife gives in more. Suggestions?"
"Here I sit on a Friday night after just passing my daughter along to her dad...

She goes with him 3 Friday nights out of the month and for some reason, this one hurts. My heart is aching. I sobbed in my car after they drove away. I never thought I would be a single mom. I never thought I’d be in such a mentally and emotionally fucked up relationship that it was best to have my daughter have 2 homes rather than one. My heart aches for my baby girl never knowing what it’s like to have her family together. I just wish things could have been different. I wish he didn’t push me to hate him so much that I left. 

Usually, I hold it all together and I am just fine. I feel strong and empowered, but tonight- I just miss my baby and I am grieving for the thought of a family that I never really had anyways, but crave so bad. Being a single parent is so hard, so rewarding, and it’s beyond confusing at times. The nights are lonely at times... I just want to be able to lay in bed with the person I created a life with and talk about our child and share the love for them. I want to be with someone who understands everything that I feel and loves she and I unconditionally. 

She and I will be okay. I’m showing her what it means to be strong and not settle in life. Even if my heart is breaking right now... right?

UPDATE: I just want to say thank you SO much to everyone who took time to reach out and relate to me. I’m 25 and my daughter is 15 months old, so she and I will both learn the ropes as we go. I woke up this morning feeling such a sense of warmth from all of you and I really appreciate it! I’m now laying in bed with my WARM cup of coffee and I’ll pick my daughter up around 5pm.  She and I will be okay!"
"My 5 year old daughter shouts for us at least 4 or 5 times a night and the broken sleep is killing us. She’s been like this for as long as I can remember.

She shouts for silly reasons like needing her blanket fixed, a cuddle etc. Any ideas on how to get her to stop shouting and just go back to sleep if she wakes without shouting us?"
"My SO and I have different parenting styles. I am stricter and believe a child should be able to do certain things on their own such as flossing your teeth, being able to use the bathroom without permission or supervision while my SO tries to teach his child to be independent but just feels it's easier to do it himself. It honestly really bugs me when he actually does things for his child that I feel could be a teaching moment. My SO's child is is still young (5) and the child's mother is still has custody so most of the time, the mother does everything for the child. Tbh, I'm also not a very involved parent to begin with like I don't play dolls and make believe with my SO's child. My involvement with the child is so minuscule that I'm more of a babysitter that keeps your child alive but that's it. When my SO's child is over, their time is usually just screen time (tv to tablet and back to tv). Could someone give me advice on how to be a better parent other than to spend more one-on-one time (I am aware and am working on it)? Thanks!

Edit: After some though, I guess I would like some advice on how to deal with my SO parenting style even though its his child. He tends to do everything for his kid like undress and redress her himself. I feel she has become used to this and expects elders to do these things instead of doing it herself. I just feel that even though she's young, he's not helping her but instead enables her. Am I wrong to think so especially since I'm not her real parent and I only see her a like 2 or 3 times a week?"
"17yo daughter has been working hard for the past year to save up for a gaming computer, she saved almost 3K by now. She’s showed me all the parts and some videos on how to build it but I’m not sure if I’m on board with it. I don’t want her buying all the parts and then not have it work.  I suggested maybe getting a new phone, clothes, a console, etc but she wants the gaming computer instead. She saved up so much and I don’t want having it all go to waste if it doesn’t work out."
"I told my daughter sometime over the winter about the phenomenom known as popcorn snow, as we witnessed it out our window. Its snowing today and there is popcorn snow again and she just pointed and said ""popcorn snow!""

I cant believe she remembers. She just turned three in March."
"My 16/f has been with her boyfriend about 6 months. They see each other almost daily. Through this quarantine he’s the only friend she’s been seeing. Lately they have been begging for a sleepover. 

I don’t think it’s sexual. Her argument is that they’re allowed to be alone for hours throughout the day, where they can have sex if they wanted to. They just want to cuddle all night.... even if they have to sleep in separate areas of the house.

I’ve been consistent with the no, the problem is her dad hasn’t been at his house. So I’m now the bad guy.

She’s very persistent and it’s reaching a boiling point. I’m at my wits end with always being asked and it’s causing a problem in our relationship. I don’t want to give in, especially now that it’s been over a month of this. 

What would you do?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for taking the time to comment. My daughter and I have had the sex talk and she is on birth control. We’ve had a good talk about it and I told her that I need some time to think. Stay safe and well everyone!"
"I have two sons.  I see them half a day every two weeks.   It's short visits because hey live 3 hours away from me so I make the trip back and forth on the same day.  

I want to spare them the long road.   I have tried renting motels or airbnbs to see them for whole weekends but it gets expensive and all that travelling around destabilized them (I couldn't always rent the same place).

So yeah, basicallt we hang out somewhere doing indoor or outdoor activities for half a day and I drive back.

During those visits, my sons (8 and 10) are extremely bad-mouthed and often disrespectful.  It feels like attention-seeking but sometimes it gets way out hands and I have to intervene.   They hurl insults at me like cursing sailors...it s scary.

I have a hard time having authority as a parent with such a limited time.  We're always 'having fun' so they are excited and hard to settle down.

Add on top of that that there is major conflict with the mother and some level of parental alienation.  Children protective services intervene 3 times in that regard.

What I am wondering....is it because my visits are too short to have any impact on discipline?  Is these behaviors symptomatic to parental alienation?  Is it because I am not strict and firm enough?  Or all of the above?

I am feeling inadequate and I am starting to kinda resent my kid's behavior and how they are turning out"
"I have my only daughter that has turned 14 this year, things have been changing so fast. I used to be simple when she was younger when it came to controlling internet access, she would just play games, and I could always pick the tablet and check what she's been doing on the internet. I know this might be a little too obsessive, but with many predators on the internet I used to take no chance. That is until teenage years begin and my wife decides to gift her a freaking iPhone. Now she spends hours upon hours in front of the phone, texting with people (friends she says) snap chatting, recording videos and stuff. I can't help but be concerned, now I don't think it is appropriate to be looking through her stuff anymore, that's why I won't just grab her phone and look through what she's up to, but again, I am always concerned, with the internet being filled with creeps I always wonder who is she talking to. She takes selfies in front of the mirror to post on instagram, arching her back as if displaying herself for the horny creeps out there, when confronted with that, she says ""that's normal, everybody does that"".
I guess that is how it is nowadays. I might be just thinking too much, but I don't like how she's always on social media so much, and texting, all the damn time. She doesn't even like going out with the family anymore. So I'm here wondering what are yours, Reddit user's thoughts on this, and if I could have an advice or any anything would help me deal with this. Thanks in advance have a good one folks.

Edit: This is my wife's Reddit account so in case you're wondering I'm the father."
"First post in this sub, seemed like a good idea...

So my wife and I just found out that we're expecting our 2nd. We're not worried about everything like we were the first time around, but I want to make sure we do the best we can with our firstborn. She's 14 and a half months old, so she'll be just shy of 2 years when the new arrival is introduced. Obviously there are going to be some challenges. 

So my question is, does anyone have any tips, pointers, or helpful experience in preparing the firstborn for the arrival of a new sibling? Her level of understanding is obviously not very complete and she's not really using language yet, but I'm interested in trying to make the transition as smooth as possible for her. 

Anyone here experience the joys of ""2 under 2""? 

Thanks!"
"Our 7 year old is hyperactive and has always, even as a baby, had to have his feet up, kicking, bouncing, or touching touching something with them.

My wife saw an instance just now and and made this comment:

""He's always doing something with his feet.  Maybe he's a PEDophile."""
"# rude*

At Christmas, we got the ""it"" item this year, a pair of Google Nest Minis. As anyone with a ""home assistant"" knows, it doesn't take kids long to figure out how to use these things...

Since then, I've noticed my daughter (4) has started speakingmore rudely and abruptly:

* ""Daddy! Read me a book!""
* ""[Brother]! Stop!""
* ""Mommy! What time is it?""

And so on...

It took me embarrassingly long to realize she was mimicking how we speak to ""Google"", and how she commands it what to do. So in the last couple weeks, I've been making an effort to append ""please"" to the end of my commands, and sometimes I'll even just say ""Hey Google. Thank you!""

We seem to be (mostly) back to polite language, but it sure feels silly being polite to a robot!

Anyone else noticing similar things? Or is it just me, the overly-polite Canadian worrying about this..."
"So tonight has been the proverbial icing on the cake for my wife and I. We have two sons, first is about 4 1/2, and overly emotional. Which is fine. Our second son is turning 3 at the end of this month. And he is our “problem child”. Attitudes always. Anger always. Stubbornness alwaysssssssss. Tonight when we weren’t paying attention to him (wife was in backyard with older son, and I went to the bathroom) he got on the kitchen counter and grabbed the windex and sprayed... no, soaked our parakeets. Which is pretty toxic for them. When we asked him why, he says “cuz I don’t like them”. We have caught him a few times being overly rough with our dogs, but they are amazing dogs would would let you chop their ear off without a growl. 

So our question is, should we be doing something more for this. In regards to getting him checked out. Like is he even old enough for a test of that sort. Who do we talk to about it. Should we wait till his 3yr appt and ask his doctor. Or is this just a normal thing that boys do, and our older one just has a normal sense of common decency. Any input we can get would be beneficial. 

PS- this whole thing could be our fault to being with... we named him kylo after kylo ren... so we may have set his fate lol"
"About to use WIC sponsored baby foods for my 7MO. I know there are restrictions and I know all babies are different.

Generally, which flavors are baby accepting of? I ask this because I don't want to get something he doesn't like and I end up wasting it on something he would have liked. I don't want to grab some mixture of pinto beans and arugula (I made that up) but if it's popular then I'd say ok I'll grab it.

Also, organic vs regular. Controversial topic. If a person starts out their life eating organic foods, does one become allergic to regular foods? I'm only interested in grabbing organic baby foods because 1. it costs more and 2, WIC is paying for it. I am by no means on any organic bandwagon.

WIC is already closed for the day, does WIC allow glass jar foods? There's no mention that's it's not included other than the baby must be 1. 4oz. 2. Mixture of fruit and/or veggies.

There's no mention of meat. Does anyone know if/when WIC allows meat to be included in the diet?"
"sorry I'm crying as I type this because I'm just having a really rough day.

I'm a first time mom of a 4 and a half month beautiful, lovely and joyful little girl who is generally quite an easy baby all except for these past few days. she's never cried for hours. sometimes it felt like hours but realistically she's probably only cried consistently for like 20 minutes once in awhile. this week has pulled a total 180 on me. what used to be such an easy sleeper has turned into an absolute nightmare. she will not take naps. at all. she is clearly exhausted but still nothing that used to work like a charm now doesn't work at all and it also took my husband and I over an hour to get her to go down and stay asleep. she also used to be so good at entertaining herself now it takes minutes for her to I guess get bored and want picked up. today just put the icing on the cake, I know we are likely experiencing the dreaded 4 month regression but I thought they just didn't sleep well. I didn't know screaming and crying until they almost pass out was a part of it. I'm just spent. I feel like she hates me. she hasn't been very smiley today or yesterday, seems like she is more happy to see my husband than me. just the incessant screaming, I don't know what to do. and I'm afraid for tomorrow bc I feel like ill be spending my very first mother's day trying to console my baby instead of enjoying it with her and making her happy. this probably seems stupid but I'm just feeling like a pos mom who has zero clue on how to make her infant daughter happy. I feel like I love her but she doesn't want me. Idk how to make her want to be held and snuggled by me.

so this is just me letting it out. I'm crying. I'm gonna cry it out and hope tomorrow we can  just enjoy some of our day."
"Hi everyone.
I am in a delima with my wife and stepson, and would love to get advice from others. 

So, my wife's son will be moving to college next April (we live in Japan), and she wants to move to same town as the college he will attend. I was explaining to her, I don't think it's a good idea since I think it's a great chance for him to experience freedom, independence and learn some responsibility.

She says she doesn't want to be far away from him, and wants him to visit during weekends. The problem is she and my stepson have a very strange relationship. My wife babies my stepson, and the he can't do anything for himself. He makes a mess around the house and expects me or her to clean it up. He even talks like a 5 year old,(in tone and way of speaking). It wasn't until my wife started giving him an allowance a few weeks ago that he started picking up his stuff (sometimes). He is going on 18, and I just find it weird that he is this irresponsible and childlike. He doesn't even have any interest in girls. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect him to know how to do everything, but simple things such as picking up clothes, or making a snack while we are at work seems pretty basic. It doesn't help my wife supports this. We got him a replacement Wii U and she wanted me set it up for him in his room. I explained to her, he should have to problem plugging two cords in, but she said it would be less stressful for him if I did it.

Whenever I try to discuss my concerns with my wife she gets angry, starts defending him and tells me I didn't raise him from a baby so you wouldn't understand. I understand that, but I just want to make sure he will be prepared for the real world. I have two friends who kind of failed at life, and now they stay at home jobless and playing video games. I've seen the pattern before and he is showing all the same signs. She also tells me that she and her son are one life and can't be apart from each other. This has also led into some other issues in our relationship, such as itimacy, lack of any romance, unwilling to do anything together if her son isn't with us. We've been married for 2 years, but dated 2 years 2 and a half years before that. 

He is a good kid, just really lazy, lacking motivation, and discipline. Since I can't seem to make any suggestions to him without the wife overruling my opinions, I've tried showing him how to be responsible through my actions. Making sure I keep the house tidy etc. When he was 12, it wasn't much of a concern since he was still somewhat a little kid, and I assumed overtime my wife would loosen up more as he got older, but things have only gotten worse.

Also, I should note if we didn't move, he would only be a 2 hour train ride from us. Which isn't bad for where we live in Japan.
Do you have an opinions own how I should approach this? No matter how nicely I try to bring it up she says ""I'm irritated, and tells me shutup"". She even recently told me she is willing to move to his area by herself. Which kind of tells me she doesn't value our relationship that much.

I'm honestly reaching the end of my rope, and even questioning if being in this relationship is worth it anymore, since I don't seem to have a voice in anything.

Any advice would be great.

Thank you"
"We've been shelter in place since mid March. Before SiP, we would put him down at 7:45, but he would roll around for 30ish minutes and actually fall asleep at 8:30. He would take a nap at daycare 12:30-2:30 but we usually let him sleep a little later, from 1-3:30/4.

Since shelter in place, though, he's progressively falling asleep later and later. We tried at first moving his bedtime back to 8. Then we started cutting back his nap time to 2 hours. But even then he's still awake, in his crib, rolling around or talking to himself. He seems tired and disregulated during the day, and angry when we wake him up from his nap.

Furthermore, he's been doing this annoying thing where he'll poop his diaper *after* we put him down for the night. Sometimes it's at 8:30, sometimes it's later at 9/9:15 but hes pooping at night every day for the past 2-3 weeks.  It almost feels like he's doing it on purpose to extend bed time. It's causing us to have to go into his room multiple times to check in on him. I can't call the bluff because that ends up with him sitting in a soiled diaper.

What the heck do we do? It's past 10:30 and he's still not asleep..."
"My daughter turns 5 at the end of July and is pre-registered to start kindergarten in the fall. She was potty trained at the age of 3 and was fairly easy to train. Had trouble with pooping in the potty, but that's been my experience with most kids (I have 7 years experience in childcare). I also have an 8-year-old boy and he was slightly difficult to potty train, but stopped wetting the bed by age 4. 

Is it normal for a child who's almost 5 to still need pull-ups for bedtime? We don't give her drinks after dinner other than a sip of water after brushing her teeth. We also take her potty before we go to sleep, usually around 11. She still has wet pull-ups every night. Any other tips/techniques we should try?"
Before this virus I was a huge homebody but I’m even at the point where I’m ready to get the heck out of this house and socialize with anyone over 4ft who doesn’t complain about being hungry or bored every five freaking seconds!!
"First thing to say is that I’m a very proud dad to the most gorgeous, beautiful 9 week old girl.

Basically I am a distant second best to mummy right now. I can’t feed her, when I hold her she doesn’t seem as comfortable in my arms, I can never seem to keep her entertained for longer than a few seconds, she hates being changed and dressed by me, when she cries I rarely can calm her down...

I’m trying my best to cope with the current situation and my wife knows all of this. 

I try to do as much of the housework and do all the cooking to let my wife focus on caring for our little one. So while I am happy that my wife is doing everything for our baby (she does an amazing job) and I have an understanding that it’s sometimes not easy for dads in these early stages, it still effects me in moments. 

I feel slightly bad for saying this, but I’m wishing her to be older already so that I can interact with her, play with her and have a bigger impact on her life.

Can anyone share their experiences and/or give some advice?"
"Hi, as the title suggests our female child who will be 7 at the end of May has been stealing, from her father and I. 

It started last year in April when we arrived at our new home (we had recently become a military family and arrived at my husband’s first duty station) she would go into our room and steal candy/snacks that we bought specifically for ourselves. 

Bear in mind (before Covid) her and her brother (almost 2) have always been given plenty of special days and treats, we semi regularly go out to dinner, to the arcade, the zoo, the mall where we spoil them with Build a Bear or The Disney store, clothing from various places, cinnabon etc depending on how they behaved/our budget etc. We don’t believe they were over spoiled this was usually a once per payday (every 2 weeks) thing and often was small (sometimes just a meal because we didn’t feel like cooking) and sometimes like during tax return/birthdays we got a little bit more extravagant.

We believed last year that we had nipped it in the bud, stuff stopped going missing, we stopped finding things gone through/touched, she started Kindergarten in August and was flourishing with school work, we got great reports from her teacher and the school staff, she made a “best friend” who is a sweet girl and a great influence. 

Well that was until about 2 weeks ago, stuff started going missing, getting moved around, handheld game systems found turned on/opened when we didn’t leave them that way, phones appeared messed with, however we chalked it up to forgetting (we have a 5 week old newborn and we’re all a bit frazzled from quarantine and are lacking sleep) and we had no proof. 

At that same time we had taken away her Nintendo DS (handheld game) due to not only poor attitude, her being unable to focus when we were speaking to her(she in general has a screen problem), general rudeness but also because she was caught more than once playing the system super late (11+ PM) at night or when she was told she could not play it. 

This week we caught her in our room 3 times and she lied(poorly) to our faces multiple times not only about why she was in our room (lies ranged from absurd to downright stupid) but what she had touched. 

We tried to calmly sit down and ask her why she was making this choice and she would only say things like “I didn’t think with my brain.” to “I was just being stupid.” to “I don’t know.” We gave her ample time to collect her thoughts and speak, we worked on breathing to calm down (as she was obviously crying having been caught) we let her know her answers would not affect her punishment as she was already in trouble but we wanted to understand why she made the choice so we could help her make better ones in the future but she gave us nothing to work with even when prompted with possible reasons for example “is it because you are mad we took your ds.” and “you were sad we told you you could not have ice cream because you refused to eats large part your dinner.”

We first took her toys with a warning books would be next, the second time as we warned we took her books with a very stern talking to her about choices and again gave her a chance to tell us why but she continued to spout nonsense answers and showed very little remorse other than what we determined were crocodile tears as she was upset she got caught but showed no remorse. She was left with only craft things like markers and coloring books. 

We discussed respect, we tried to make her understand how violated we felt, explained that our bedroom is the one room for just mom and dad to be alone, we asked if she would like if we went into her room, moved things, took her books or toys or special treats (she has Easter candy in her room) she stated that she would not like it and she would feel sad and mad if we did that to her. We really thought we had gotten through to her. 

We don’t love physical punishment plus spankings does not affect her at all so we told her we would be taking her birthday away if she went in our room again. We made sure to have a very thorough discussion about expectations, how her choices were her own and she had to set a good example for her brother and new baby sister. She seemed to understand and be very encouraged that they look up to her. 

Well just 1 day later she was in our room again, my husband who is 100% the calmer more permissive parent who defends our oldest to the death snapped, he not only spanked her but told her she lost her birthday and asked me to text/email grandparents to let them know we won’t be accepting gifts and that this was a joint decision we did not take lightly. 

My MIL called and basically helped us have a family talk on speakerphone (though I don’t like her at all  I was civil and heard her out) we agreed to give our daughter one more chance with the stipulation(outside of our daughters hearing) that if she messed up in the same way again mil will never stick her nose in again but she is certain she got through to our daughter as our daughter hates disappointing her nana. 

Our daughter did admit her reason for doing all this is “it’s unfair you have so much more than me.” We explained that we are adults who work in and outside the home, we have had more time to accumulate stuff as we are older and though we love her she is not an equal in this house and she needs to stop believing she is. 

Did we do the right thing? Should we not have backed down? What would you do? Any general advice as this kid seems not only to lack basically any impulse control but is also bullheaded and lacking some common sense."
"I know it sounds ridiculous but does anyone else look at their baby and think I cannot wait to see you grow? Seeing my son do new things everyday I think goddamn I can’t wait to hear you talk, your personality. Like I cry thinking about the things he will do, how sweet he will be. It’s overwhelmingly wonderful to watch your little human being grow, We are so privileged. 

Did your babies turn out how you imagined them to?"
"Hey all,

Our 2.5 y/o daughter is usually pretty even tempered, but as of late she’s developed a new trait that we’re trying to nip in the bud. Whenever we eat, we each have our plates at the table. She straight up refuses to eat what’s on her plate, and points and screams and says “mommy/daddy sit”, implying that she wants to sit on our laps and eat our food. After nonstop screaming, we unfortunately cave, and she’ll eat all our food without letting us take a bite. Everyone has the same food on their plate, so it’s not a matter of us eating something tastier. 

Just now, my wife and I were having a banana ice pop, and we decided to give her one as a special treat. She took hers, and then shrieked endlessly for 15 minutes because she also wanted ours. This is before she even started eating hers. We tried swapping with her and the meltdowns continued. She just wants all of the food for herself, and none for us. I believe it’s a power thing, but I’m not sure of the best way to curb it. We just kept telling her “this is NOT okay. Everyone gets their own”, which didn’t seem to affect her state of mind at all. 

Any tips appreciated.. 😱😱

Thanks all, great advice!"
"If she witnessed it, she cries and is hyperconcerned, in small part to make it about her and draw attention, but also in part because she's a very empathetic soul.

If she caused the injury, it's much worse because she also layers on self-blame and says she's stupid or clumsy.

She has always been this way and it's not better or worse, just about the same. She's 11 now.

Parents: advice? Something you've encountered? Something that required counseling to resolve?"
"A little while ago, when Bill Withers died, my husband and I sang Lean on Me to our kids and tried to teach them a little of it.  That was nice and I want to start singing more with them. But not insipid crap like wheels on the bus. 

Any suggestions for easy to sing songs that adults will like too?  Bonus for songs with music videos to learn a dance to as well.

Thus far I've got radar love, girls wanna have fun, and free fallin.

(Besides old town road lol)."
"My daughter is finally walking, so today I had all the doors in the house open so she could follow me about as I went room to room to do things. I have never felt such greater joy watching this little human walk behind me following me around and just smile and laugh just happy to be around me experiencing the wonders each room had to offer."
"My husband is working full-time (10 hour shifts M-F) while I stay at home with our three month old. I do the majority of care for our son, with my husband taking over after work for a few hours and 3 nights out of the week so I can get some rest. 

Recently, there was a positive covid case found at my husband's workplace. My husband chose to quarantine at his parent's house until he knew whether or not he would also test postive. Thankfully, he got a negative result and his workplace also ramped up on protocol to keep their employees safe. My husband came back home a week ago.

During the time he was away, I took care of my son alone all day and every night. I feel like he became accustomed to only having me around and having Dad back has been an adjustment. We are trying to get back to our regular schedule and it has been good, except that our son cries whenever my husband tries to care for him. It is at the point where if I leave the room for any extended period of time, our son becomes almost inconsolable. 

This has been very difficult for my husband because I know he wants to build a relationship with our son. He wants so bad to be able to take care of him. I've been trying my best to give them as much time as possible together and I'm trying to only help if my husband asks for it (this is difficult for me because I have an anxiety disorder and I tend to like being in control of most situations). 

I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with a situation similar. If so, how did you manage to build back that relationship back with your child? My hope is that sooner or later our son will get used to having his Dad around again and that they can build a relationship with one another."
"So me and my ex-wife split when our son was around 4 and my current wife split with her husband when her daughter was around 3ish. We met when the kids were 5 and 4, her daughter spends some time at her dads but her mom has primary custody of her just like I have primary custody of my son. We didn't move in together till our kids were 7 and 6, while at the time they both liked it. When the kids were 8 and 7, me and my wife got married and we all moved in together.

The problem is that they fight CONSTANTLY, like I wasn't ready for the amount of fighting.  They are both very very stubborn kids and getting either to compromise is like pulling teeth.  I got lucky that they don't hit each other or any of that but screaming matches and being annoyed or mad at the other is daily.  

Recently my son told me he's done sharing stuff with his sister and wants to be an only child again.  My wife told me that her daughter is getting tired of sharing things too.  I am at a loss at what to do cause while they can play together and they do that often and get along, they fight about 40-50 percent of the day.  

I am at a loss on what to do, is this something normal families go through too?  Where the kids don't want to have a sibling anymore?  Or is this a blended family issue?  I need advice on what to do cause I'm really at a loss.  

TL;DR:Me and my wife got married about 10 months ago and our kids fight constantly and both said they don't want a sibling anymore and I don't know what to do."
"If a child comes within a 10 foot radius of any beverage, the child will gravitate toward the beverage resulting in the beverage being spilled. The likelihood of spillage is directly proportional to its difficulty to remove from fabrics."
Looking for ideas for my toddler while she's home. Tired of feeding her the same stuff and all the stuff i see when I search is all extra healthy (not the there's anything wrong with healthy). I just want some well rounded lunches.
"First of all, I just wanted to say that I think my situation is normal, but I would like to have other people's opinion on it, just to make sure.  It has to do with my kids' (preteen to early teen years) interactions with their school friends.  This was before the pandemic too. They interact with their school friends IRL during school, but after school, they almost exclusively communicate with them online (discord and games), and not in real life.  I'm totally okay with this.  When I was a teenager, I would say about half my time with friends was online.  But do young teens nowadays mostly chat / game online with their friends, or should I be arranging meetups and stuff?  I read that kids their age usually arrange their own meetups.  Thanks for your input!"
"One of my children is pretty messy. He’s 12 and bored af during quarantine. His bedroom is a disaster area at the moment. 

He’s taken his tv off the wall and has propped it atop a desk with like three gaming systems set up around it. Clean clothing strewn everywhere. Nerf guns piled with playing cards and baseball batting gloves Velcro’d around the leg of a chair. And for the final touch, I see a dick’s been drawn onto one of his Rick and Morty posters. 

I kinda just wanna say f it and let him do his thing. As long as the room’s not dirty and he cleans every once in a while, should I let it be?! I’m in the thick of it right now and would much prefer another activity on a Saturday. So, how many of you still clean your kids rooms?"
"We just had our first kid, and my wife has lots of experience with kids and babies, and I have comparatively little, but I'm good at swaddling, feeding, etc.

But I'm so paranoid! I'm always checking his breathing and rushing for the bulb syringe when he spits up, bolting to him when he cries, and beating myself up for not getting the formula mixture exactly right.

Wife says I'm stressing myself out, but I have no way to turn my anxiety down. I just wanna be a good dad and husband, but it feels like I'm fucking those up with my anxiety and paranoia. 

What do?"
"Our 10 year old son got 2 Guinea Pigs for his birthday last year. He takes care of them for the most part (mom and dad do most of the cleaning, but he helps) they have become part of the family. Seems like one of the guinea pigs may be dying. Waiting on the vet to get back with us. Our son has autism and tends to be very literal. Unplanned changes affect him greatly. (He has come very far).

In case our guinea pig does pass, need some help and guidance from other parents. How have you discussed a pet dying with a 10 and 8 year old? Any parents out there have tips for discussing this with a child on the spectrum?"
"This is a long story, but I’ll try to make it short. I’m from the south, my husband is from the northeast. A couple years ago we moved down south from New England to be closer to my family. My husband had a difficult time adjusting. I think he must have been homesick because he was never motivated to find reliable work or help achieve any of the goals we had set for ourselves.  He went through a depressive stage. Anyways, a friend of his offered him a decent job in New England and he jumped on it. So, now we are back on the east coast. 
My issue is that I think his mother played a huge role in his attitude about living a thousand miles away and constantly influenced him to move back home. Which is fine, I get it. She missed him and wanted him close. However, I have no family around here and I often feel lonely myself. My other issue is she never offers to help with our kids which is the polar opposite of how my mother in Tennessee is. She enjoyed taking the kids for a day or two every other weekend. My mother in law says she did her time raising kids and doesn’t want to do anything anymore. I respect her decision, but I can’t help feeling resentful towards her. I’m in grad school, working, maintaining the house, and raising the kids. It would be nice to have a break every now and than. She still insists on seeing the grandkids every week, but never alone. She is not disabled or anything like that. She has a very type A personality and I just feel like she manipulated my husband into moving back for her own selfish needs. I miss my family and feel like I would be better off near them. She s married and has another son with three kids, so it’s not like she was alone after we moved away. I’m alway quaint with her, but internally I don’t want to be around her because of my resentment. Can anyone tell me if my feelings are invalid or valid or offer any advice? Thanks for reading &lt;3"
"Given our current circumstance, screen time has increased a bit. I'd like to turn some of that time from educational cartoon shows to some real life animal-oriented educational show. I've tried National Geographic, but that isn't oriented towards young kids. She loves the animals doing stuff, but a 60 minute documentary on sharks will feature 10 minutes of sharks scattered between 50 minutes of scientists talking on boats. 

Anyone  have any recommendations?"
"My boy is two and a half (31 months) and ever since we started potty training, he is terrified of the idea of peeing. Even after we decided he wasn’t ready and put diapers back on him, every time he has the urge to pee he freaks out. He jumps from foot to foot rapidly, asks to be held, and if we ask if he has to pee or if he wants to use the potty, he refuses. 

We’re worried he’s gonna give himself a UTI or something by holding it for so long, and we’re concerned we did something wrong that scared him of the whole process. We never forced or held him on the potty, or anything like that... we just gently prompted and explained. 

Has anyone else experienced this behavior? We have no idea how to progress from here."
"Okay so I have two daughters who are 6 and 2(almost3). I’ve always been a firm believer in being honest with your children and if they ask a question they should get an age appropriate answer. I grew up in a house where sex and puberty were absolutely not talked about EVER. I never spoke to my mum before having sex, going on contraception and didn’t talk to her the first time I was raped by my ex. I was 15 and I wasn’t sure if it was classed as rape or not and felt too embarrassed to talk to her. I never wanted that for my children. 

So I am currently pregnant with baby number 3! This along with my daughter wanting to breed snakes when she’s older and watching a lot of videos on reptiles by breeders has brought on a lot of questions which her stepdad and I have answered honestly. For around a month or so the questions started with puberty and what happens, then how a baby grows inside you and then eventually how the baby is actually made. We answered all her questions and it also gave us a good opportunity to talk to her about her body and boundaries. This is very important to me as her dad is my ex I mentioned who sexually abused me. I found out after leaving him that he also sexually assaulted others including a minor. There is a police investigation but at the minute he still gets supervised contact until it goes to trial. As you can imagine teaching her about how these are things that only adults do and about when it’s appropriate for an adult to look at or touch her body (drs appointments etc) was important to me so this was the ideal time to gently introduce that. She was happy with the answers given and seems to be over the curiosity. I have now received some backlash from friends and family members saying how she was way too young to know all of this information and that I’m essentially taking away her innocence. 

Looking for other opinions on this. She is turning 7 soon and is extremely bright, always has been. I never offered more information that what she asked and she really didn’t seem bothered by these answers at all. My boyfriend is in agreement with me."
"Our third child, a beautiful little girl, was born 5 days ago. I had an unremarkable pregnancy but the birth was a bit traumatic. As we were both healthy, we could go home a day later. 
Now, from the very start on, our daughter was a quiet kid. She sleeps a lot. We figured, she'd eventually wake up more and I enjoyed the sleep we'd get. As I said, this is my third child and I realize that every child is different. But this baby just sleeps. All day long and then all through the night. She will wake up, get a little restless and signal she wants  to be fed. If it doesn't happen soon, she'll cry but then stop after a while. Usually, I just feed her when she shows signs of hunger (or wake her up if she sleeps too long). She'll then nurse for a while and fall right back asleep. Nursing works fine as does her digestion. At five days, she's a little above her birth weight, so she's apparently getting enough. 

But other than right before feeding, she's never awake. She is awake with her eyes open for less than an hour a day. And it just doesn't get more. 
The pediatrician and the midwife that we asked both think that it's a little unusual but they're confident that she will eventually wake up more. Pediatrician also said to wait for the screening results (all babies here are screened for rare metabolic diseases like congenital hypothyreosis) but he doesn't think it fits any of the screened diseases since she feeds well.

She was also looked at by a pediatrician before we left the hospital and other than a failed auditory test on the right side (left side was fine) which they attributed to faulty equipment and which will be retested, soon, she was fine. No signs of heart trouble or jaundice. 

So while we wait for her to wake up a bit more, I just wanted to hear, other people's experiences. Has anybody had a newborn that was excessively sleepy? How did things turn out? When did they start to be more awake? Or have you found any other reasons why your kid slept so much? 

Thank you so much!

Edit: Baby finally woke up and looked at us with her big, beautiful eyes. She managed to stay awake for quite a while and my husband immediately took the opportunity to introduce her to some terrible music. 
Feels like we're finally getting to know her. 
Thanks everybody for the advice!"
"This is a long story but I’ll try and make it quick. 
I had a pretty bad relationship with my ex but we had two kids together, it ended badly (my fault) and he subsequently hates me. It ended nearly 5 years ago and we have always struggled to co-parent, he’s aggressive and a narcissist which has had a huge impact on the kids. He’s essentially managed to alienate my daughter from me and our son has adhd so between the two it’s a lot. 
Everything came to a head about a year ago as I asked him to please stop bad mouthing me to the kids, they were confused and were telling me the things he’d said. I won’t go into it but there’s a lot of bad language included. 
He ended up losing his mind and refused to see the kids for nearly 2 months but before this he told them I was taking them away and they’d never see him again, so you can imagine how they acted when, low and behold, they were with me and weren’t seeing their dad. Even though I never have stopped them.

My daughter especially had a breakdown, she was 7 at the time, hitting, punching, kicking and biting me every day for taking her dad away. Of course I never bad mouthed him and just kept saying he just needs a bit of time. After a couple months of this he decided to see them again but by this time both kids decided they didn’t want to see me anymore because I’d kept them from their dad.

Finally managed to get them to come for weekends, obviously my heart is broken into a thousand pieces but I’m just trying to make their time here as nice as possible when they’re here. I honestly believe this isn’t parenting anymore, it’s just about enjoying them. Their behaviour is getting worse and worse, they’re rude, mean and spoilt. 

My partner and I fall out quite a bit because the kids are so unruly and I don’t try to change their behaviour as much as I should but it honestly feels so pointless? When they are here for such a short time it seems there’s no point trying to put positive enforcements in place when they are at their dads so much. Help?"
"2 yr 4 mo - Wonderful boy. Low stress. Happy. No technology around him. 

But once in a while we have a real tantrum and it’s as the title says. 

Often we try letting him cry it out. Especially some things like plug ins or cars around leave no room for folding. 

Other times it’s something silly: doesn’t want to wait for us to finish eating to play or there are no more strawberries. 

He will cry till A) vomiting/panic attack B) he gets his way C) we open a stupid YouTube video for 10+ min. 

Oddly a random thing may distract him for 15 seconds (look a cat! Bubbles!) and he will stop crying..... then continue. 

Completely lost on what to do. 

We hold him. Try to explain. All just often makes him cry harder. 

Help. Please. Thank you."
"Baby got that flat head even when I bought him a baby pillow. Going in to get checked for a helmet next week. What should I expect from him? More crying 'cause his head is being compressed from the side? Less sleep for me?

At 7 months, WIC gave baby baby foods. I checked online about feeding schedules and I'm a bit overwhelmed. From 3 months to present, he's being bottle fed 6 ounces 4-5 hours. Now, it's telling me to ramp up the feeding?

Quick Google search has the baby feeding every waking hour before nap now? I dunno, my lack of experience tells me 6 ounce formula + a container of baby food seems like a lot.

Am I sticking with 6-8oz formula rule?

I usually got to sleep at 11pm and I put the baby to sleep at 8pm. Should I try to dreamfeed him or just it be? I never bothered with this dreamfeed simply because I just want to go to bed. How much should I dreamfeed him?

With the weather getting warmer, should I stick with warm formula or is it ok to go with room temperature? When/if is it ok to go with fridge-cold formula?"
"Hello, I have a situation and I would love some opinions on the subject.

I am a father of five children ages 3 to 14. I have been separated from my wife for over a year and a half. She had a boyfriend who sexually molested my oldest daughter. Because of that and her being suicidal the court ruled that I be granted temporary custody for a year. The court also stated that I am to supervise visits between her and the children. The problem is this woman hates me and does not respect the fact that the court-appointed me as the supervisor. On two separate occasions she has asked me for more time with them and when I told her that I am only giving her as much time as the court says she can have shes gets really angry. The first time she started yelling and insulting me and asking me to read the court paperwork all in front of the children. I told her to stop and that we could talk about this privately but she continued to yell and I said that if she didn't calm down I would have to take the children and cancel the visit early. She grabbed our three year old and told me to pry her from her cold dead hands. So I walked out of the house until she had calmed down. The second time was last night. The visit was already running late because she didn't bring a dinner (She has agreed to feed them dinner (the visits are always in the evening)) so the kids were eating close to bedtime. She asked to stay a little later and I said she could stay until they are done with dinner. My three year started getting upset that she was leaving so I told her that she would tuck her in and this appeased her. When we were upstairs and I was putting the other children to bed my oldest daughter started fighting with me over screens. I had to take the screen away from her because of her lashing out in anger with me but my ex-wife started joining in. She started belittling me and telling me I'm a bad parent and I'm not handling the situation correctly and that I'm wrong about everything I do with them. I asked her to leave and I told my oldest daughter that she needed some time to herself to collect her thoughts and to cool off a bit and that we would talk again in 15 minutes. She didn't calm down and my ex-wife was up there just fanning the flames. I asked her to leave a few more times and she refused and told me to call the cops.

I called the cops and showed them the court paperwork. When they came into the house they called out her name and she refused to respond every time they called her name. She made the police come all the way upstairs where she was clutching my youngest and oldest daughter. They politely told her that it was time to leave and she started telling them that my house was a pig stye and that I am a piece of shit and I don't deserve the children and the police just calmly told her that it was for the courts to decide and that it's time for her to leave.

After she left I had to spend an hour talking to each of the children individually. I had to practice breathing exercises with my oldest daughter because she was having a panic attack.

I'm not asking for legal advice, my questions is what should I have done and what can I do in the future if I am still required to supervise her with my children? She doesn't listen to anything I say and she refuses to back down or cool off at all.

Is there a better way to phrase ""I think you should go cool off for a few minutes and then we can talk about this again?""

How should I have handled my oldest daughter in that situation? What do you do when you have someone else breathing down your neck? I thought de-escalating the situation was the best thing to do, was that correct?

I guess I am just second-guessing all of my parenting instincts right now.

Again, I am NOT looking for legal advice. Thanks!"
"My daughter just turned 4 and my 2nd one just turned one recently.  Google Photos keeps sending me these  "" Rediscover this day"" photos and videos and I get kinda sad looking at them.  Especially my 4 years old when she was a baby or even when she was 3!  Where all these years go?  Anyways I'm just wondering if that's normal as a daddy."
"Hi parents I need some advice. I have a newly 3 year old boy who used to be an angel at bedtime. He had a great routine that we followed every night (just a simple bath, books, little snuggle then bed) and he would happily play in his room alone until he fell asleep. 

Lately, all hell has broken loose. He will sit at his bedroom door (which we now leave open so he can wake me if he needs the toilet at night) screaming “Mummmmmmy!” or “Dadddddddddy!” at the absolute top of his lungs while sobbing like he just found out his parents died. He has an endless string of demands but mostly they centre around either a reason to leave the room (“I need to pee”) or a reason to make us stay (“I can’t find my drink bottle”). It is horrible. 

Right now I’m doing bedtime alone and he’s sitting in the door screaming “Mummy!” Over and over. 

Do other people’s children do this? How do you guys respond? Any advice to make bedtime less traumatic for us all?"
This virus is so crazy that I forgot that Sunday is Mother’s Day and I’m a mother🤦‍♀️ And that my sons birthday is in a few weeks. And that I have to enroll my daughter into kindergarten Monday 😬
"*EVERY TIME* he eats anything, he makes that choking sound like when you're trying to cough up mucus. It's been this way for months. I can't just tell him to quit it, and I definitely can't punish him for it, because if ever he actually needs to do it, I don't want him thinking it's a bad thing to do. But it's like every fucking time he swallows anything. Even ***ICE CREAM***. Like... HOW!?

Any time I ask him why he's doing it, he just says ""I don't know""

I've tried drilling it into his head that he needs to chew slower and all the way, but to no avail.

It's driving me insane. Please help."
"My son will be 2 in a few weeks and is the most picky ever I have ever came across! I assume it’s normal for toddlers to be picky but I feel like he is so extreme. Normal foods that young kids eat like chicken nuggets, PBJ, grilled cheese, macaroni and cheese, spaghetti, etc he wants absolutely nothing to do with. He doesn’t like eggs, grapes, apples, bananas, oranges, blueberries, or ANY fruit. As soon as it touches his mouth and he feels the texture, he immediately spits it out. He has gone through phases where he will eat a PBJ for weeks straight, or grapes as a snack for days in a row but then he’s done with it and wants nothing to do with it again. When I try new things, or try to feed him what I made for my SO and I, my son won’t even give it a chance. As I’m walking towards him with the plate of new foods, he will already have a look on his face like ‘nope’. In the mornings I can usually get him to eat a Eggo waffle with syrup (not healthy, obvi), for lunch sometimes he’ll eat a hot dog with no bun or sauce, and for dinner it’s a complete toss up if he will eat at all. I make him multiple meals and it just doesn’t work. Veggies, pasta, nothing! So frustrating. He likes to snack on gold fish through out the day with some juice. His all time  favorite snack that he will eat no matter what is chocolate donuts but I really want to break him of this terrible eating pattern he has. I’m not sure what to do!! Anyone gone through this before? Any tips? Thanks!"
"Mother of 2 young kids (2 and 9 months) and hear this alllll the time from parents of older children. It’s certainly true but in the moment, I can’t help but fail at this. I so desperately want to take this advice and just soak up every minute because I know time flies (also repeated to me by older people) but I get so easily distracted..the chores need to be done and I’m tired and how long till bedtime?? Lol Any advice out there from awesome parents who do manage to soak up this precious time without their minds racing in other directions and counting the hours until you can get a break??"
"Hi all, I’m hoping SOMEONE may be able to help me out here. My husband and I have been trying to potty train our 3 year old. Some background:

April 2019 - we tried the Oh Crap! Potty training method. We crashed and burned. It ended with him holding his pee for about 12 hours, then peeing in the bathtub and subsequently being terrified of the potty. It took us 6 months to just get him to sit on the potty again. 

Throughout 2019 and 2020 we have had some (maybe 2?) unsuccessful and fleeting attempts at potty training. 

We tried again and it ended in my son holding his pee so long that he was in pain and couldn’t release in the bath. He finally went when he fell asleep (thankfully). 

I am at a complete loss on what to do. Do we stop and wait? We have tried rewards, stickers, underwear, being stern, prompting, no prompting, trying to make it part of a routine, being casual, being structured. Every time is the same: He holds his pee until he gets a diaper (nap time when he naps) or bedtime. No amount of extra liquids helps the situation (that’s what go us into a pickle yesterday). 

Any guidance would be SO appreciated. Any of my mom friends or family have had children that just “went” one day....no holding issues at all. He also isn’t motivates by things like peeing on Cheerios or peeing standing up. 

Sorry for the rant....I am at a loss on what to do and feeling like a failure as a mom. Thank you guys."
"
I have a little man, 4 months and I’m also a single parent. Bath time is perfect, he loves the water, doesn’t mind being washed. However the problem is taking him out the bath in a way where I don’t get soaked or I have to put him somewhere awkward. I have a solid washing basket (with a lid kind of thing) in the bathroom that I used to be able to lay his towel on then place him on there, wrap him like a burrito and go. He’s always been quite long but now he definitely cannot fit on there. I have been resorting to just putting him on me and accepting being soaked first before wrapping the towel around him as I carry him. 

Yes, seemingly idiotic question but I’m a first time mum. I’m either missing something very obvious or this is a genuine problem for lots of people lmao. 

Am I missing something truly simple? -also, doesn’t help that he behaves like an eel when being taken out of the tub."
"Hi everyone!

My husband and I are currently expecting, and I will be returning to work full-time after 12 weeks. We have not finalized anything, but we plan on having my MIL watch LO 2-3 days and my mom watch LO the other 2-3 days/week. They have both offered to do so for free; however, my husband and I are planning on offering them \~$30/day and any gas money (we want them to come to our house). 

As of right now, the plan is for them to watch LO for \~2 years. At that point, depending on how everything is going, we will consider putting LO in daycare for socialization. We are starting to think of some rules/boundaries for our moms to follow, but we are having a hard time. I am sure it will be easier once we actually have our baby, but all we have so far are these (specifically for 3-6 months):

* All feeding is on-demand (excluding visiting me on my lunch break)
* All sleeping is on-demand

Absolutely No:

* Food or beverages other than breastmilk
* Discipline of any kind
* Screen time

All of that seems pretty obvious, but we can't think of anything else. And as far as rules/boundaries for anything 6+ months, we are still stuck. 

Can anyone help us out? If you had grandparents watching your infant/toddler, what 'rules' would you put in place for them?

I should add that we \*somewhat\* want to raise our children using Montessori principles, so that is something we will have to consider also."
"I’ve never had lice before.  I’m wondering how the hell the tween managed to pick it up during a pandemic.  (I know how.  She still is getting out of home services for her high functioning autism.  Had to have come from there.). I had to pin down and shave my non verbal three year old’s head bare, because after much trying there was no way he’d let me comb his hair out.

I’m tired and heartbroken over the lose of my little boys beautiful curls.  I’ve been trying to stay strong and have been reassuring the girl child she is absolutely not in trouble, it’s not a big deal, and we’ll get through this just fine.

What I want to do is bawl and not stop until I’m too dehydrated to continue.  Life is already so stressful right now, and this is almost too much to cope with...

I’m mostly just here to...  Scream into the internet void I guess.  I’m treating and cleaning and doing what I can.  Sympathy or tips appreciated.  Used NIX and oil, have been combing out daily, and washing bedding and clothing daily.  Have wiped down and vacuum mattresses and couches.  Washed what pillows I could, warped the rest in garage bags.  We have laminate floors.  Bagged all soft toys too.  If anyone can think of a place I’ve missed cleaning, please point it out.  Thank you..."
"1. Turned on the bidet, letting it shoot across the bathroom into our closet (which soaked all of our freshly washed laundry)

2. Poops in the tub literally every single time I bathe her

3. Pulled her diaper off and smeared shit on me and our bed to wake me up (not once but 3 times)

4. Pulled all of the plants out of the garden

5. Found the fresh dog turd in the yard to stomp around in

6. Learned that she can spit out her drinks at people

I’ve been trying to find the humor in it all and to stay positive but maaaan, I can’t wait for all this to be over so I can drop her off my relatives and take a long ass nap"
"I hope this isn't against the rules, I'm not really asking for advice, more sharing advice, but I have to share success story this with some fellow parents.

When our son was born (He is 22 months now), we got and received the normal number of various stuffies and blankets and such.  We watched to see which ones he liked best and to identify which one became the ""special"" one, so we could make sure it didn't get lost, donated, etc.  He eventually settled on this little elephant with a blanket body thing from Carters as his special one, and we named him Snuggly (well, nickname, his full name is Sir Snugglous de Snuggington, Fifth Snug Snearl of Snuggington forest, Snug Knight Defender of the Realm, and Member in Good Standing of the Royal Order of Snuggles) 

Unbeknownst to me at the time, once we were pretty sure that he was The One, my wife went on Carters website to by a back up.  Then she saw they were discontinued and on clearance so bought TEN back ups.

When they arrived I ribbed her a bit for OVER worrying about this, I've heard the stories of kids losing them and parents frantic search to find, I had one as a kid and had a few close calls, but didn't think it was that big a deal.

Boy was I wrong.

There have been a few times where he got dirty or something and it was convienient to have a back up to swap out, but nothing that big a deal.  Until today.

The Pooka is sick today, and his last set of molars is coming in, so he is not having a good day at all.  All he wants is mommy snuggles, PJ Masks, and Snuggly.  Well, after he ate a bit this morning, he was cuddling with snuggly and promptly threw up right on his head.  He was SO upset, not just at throwing up, which is new for him so he didn't understand what was going on, but because he did it to snuggly.  Obviously we had to take snuggly and he needs to get washed, and that just added to the trauma, but luckily, mom to the rescue, I took snuggly to the other room for a ""quick bath"" and he came back all nice and clean. (We have been rotating them through so they all have about the same amount of wear and smell to them)  Then, a short while later, I am changing his dirty diaper and he tries to help, with snuggly in his hand, and yup, you know what happened.  Trauma, tears, but another quick bath and snuggly was back! Then, just now, snuggly went head first into the trash, where I had just emptied the jar of excess sour dough starter.  A few minutes later though, snuggly was good as new! 

All in all, its been a very rough day for snuggly!

Any one of those incidents would have resulted in snuggly being unavailable for a couple hours to go through the wash and dry.  If we hadn't had back ups, or even just one back up, a rough day would have become a catastrophic day!

But it didn't and its all thanks to my genius wife!

(And a word of advice, if its at all possible, make sure you get back ups for your kids favorite stuffy and stash them away too!)

Edit: I absolutely love everyone’s stories and names of their kids favorite stuffy/lovey/bubby/etc. This was a long, rough day (he is doing much better now, fever broke a few hours ago and he is finally sleeping) and these stories were something I didn’t even know I needed to hear tonight! Thank you all!"
"My daughter is 3, and she is a trouble maker. She has been opening the front door and running out of the house, and just starts running away. I have already installed 2 locks on the door, a deadbolt and another one I don't know the name of, but it stops the door from opening. The type of door I have is one where if you pull the handle, it unlocks. I have the locks high up, but she gets anchair and stands on it to open them. Are there any locks that are not easy to be opened? I had door stoppers installed but she broke them. Any advice helps"
"My son just turned 2, but has had breathing problems for the better part of a year. After getting me pediatrician to actually listen to my concerns about him, he recommended me to an ENT. 

We had an appointment to visit the ENT on March 23rd. That appointment got cancelled because of covid. We did 3 virtual appointments with her throughout April. We put him on Zyrtec and Flonase, since it’s allergy season. Didn’t help. After her seeing videos of his nap time and night time breathing, she suggested to try a steroid to shrink the tonsils and see how the reaction was. 6 day dose of prednisone, it was fantastic. At day 10, we were back to where we started. 

Waiting it out another 2 weeks, I couldn’t bare seeing him struggle sleeping. We visited the ENT in person today since they reopened the office visits. The second she looked in his throat, she said, “wow. Yes, they are pretty big”. She the. Suggested we removed them and that will help him breathe at night. 

She called me back a few hours later to confirm that the nearby hospital is good to have the surgery there. Weird timing with covid, but he will have to get tested prior (new guidelines). 

Ultimately, she said the surgery can be scheduled as soon as 2 weeks from now. 

1. Has your child had their tonsils and adenoids out? How was it?

2. Anyone know anyone who had surgery in the hospital since covid? How was it?

I’m nervous, but also a bit relieved. Look forward to the responses."
"Things my 1.5 year old and 4 year old have fought over today: a cheap rubber ducky, a plastic spoon found on the trail, a stick. 

How about your kids?"
"If you were selecting a caregiver at this time, which would you prioritize: someone great with the child, or someone who'd limit your family's COVID exposure?

Context: Living in an area of the US that isn't taking COVID seriously (lifting restrictions despite no evidence of a decline, crowds of people out socializing without masks), we've decided to avoid daycare for the next few months. We're seeking the cheapest part-time nanny we can find for our 6 mo so we can continue to work from home and hide from the world. Our desire for serious social distancing was in the ad and reiterated during interviews.

*Limited Exposure Candidate* has no experience with babies (but does with older kids), doesn't intend to seek other employment but will be busy with online classes, and has no roommates nor family nearby.

*Good for Baby Candidate* has experience with infants and gives off that ""dream nanny"" vibe like LO will be given full attention and affection all day (and has gushing references), but lives with a large family, has many friends nearby, and will likely return to a waitressing job once the restaurant re-opens.

We're in a college town and this summer I'm expecting a surge in COVID due to our area's poor response."
"She is our one and only, and she’s always embraced the “baby” role, even now.  She had her first period on her birthday in March and she was devastated.  Since then she’s had 2 more (currently on it). 

Her behavior has been the same all three times. She sits on the toilet for a long time and just cries, saying “I’m so sad”....”I want to be little”....etc.  I try to comfort her and say “I know it’s sad, it’s not fair, I’m sorry.”  I try to coax her off the toilet with setting her up with a blanket and pillows but she’s very afraid of getting blood on the couch/bed.  If she does get off the toilet she insists on standing for a long time, just crying. Nothing I do seems to help.

I am still having periods, and shes witnessed me go through all the crappy stuff.  I do tell her it’s ok to cry and part of the menstrual cycle is hormones making you emotional.  But I could use some tips if anyone has some advice on what to say/do to help her accept that this is just gonna happen once a month and how we can cope with it."
"It’s been a year-long struggle, but has reached a head today. 

She’s been postponing work, procrastinating, and has started this cycle of falling behind and catching up. She’s got a nasty attitude with everyone, even with gentle reminders and encouragement. Doesn’t respond to my efforts to help her with organization and accountability AT ALL. She even screamed at me for printing out her daily agenda or worksheets “I can do it myself mom.” She lies to me daily about her work being done. Puts off basic chores by finding any excuse to not get them done. I pretty much at this point have chosen to pick up her slack with chores so she can focus on school because she doesn’t like me or dad “butting in” but it hasn’t helped. 

And when she gets busted or called out it turns into a day-long ordeal. 

She again fell behind, hasn’t completed work since Monday, or chores since Saturday. One of her chores is to walk the dogs (shared with older brother) and the dogs have done their business on my carpet now 5 days in a row. These are well-behaved trained 3 year old dogs. (They both lied to me this morning about taking them out for a run this morning but I suppose that’s another matter.) To make matters worse, my husband just started work again this Monday. He had to leave work early yesterday because she was throwing a tantrum and I had reached the end of my coping mechanisms... My husband came home and was able to diffuse and redirect... with our help she completed chores and some homework. Emphasis on “some.” We just try to take things One day at a time. 

Well again today, after refusing to wake up and eat, was late to log on. Then kept signing off and on.  I participating. Then During a review game today she was unprepared. Signed off of Zoom angrily when she couldn’t answer a question. Teacher at this point has completely given up on her. 

Mind you, I’m trying it manage all this, walk the dogs, clean up dog mess, keep up on unfinished chores, check up
On the two of them, help them study for exams next week.... while working from home. (My business is currently shut down, but I am providing virtual services for clients and currently working on an industry-wide campaign for reopening.) 

I’m in full breakdown mode. Again. She’s currently being obedient and folding clothes downstairs. Begging me not to call dad (she understands clearly that when he leaves work we lose money)... 

I get she’s stressed that she’s behind and unprepared for class but I can’t help her - she refuses. 

At my wits end. 

Encouragement is appreciated."
"My oldest just turned 16 and is finally willing to learn how to drive. It is so nerve racking. He's constantly telling me he knows as I'm giving advice for situations he's never encountered or complaining I wasn't clear when he's done it a dozen times before. Then, he either stops 10 feet before he's supposed to stop or stopping suddenly way too close. And he never checks before changing lanes! I'm not sure I can do this again next year when my middle child turns 15."
"Hello! My daughter has begun to develop and I've been talking to her about wearing a bra/training bra. She actually wanted to wear one before she was noticeably developing so I let her get some training bras and figured it would be good since I knew the actual need for one would be coming soon. However, now that she has tried them, she hates them. She finds them to be uncomfortable and doesn't like the feeling of wearing one. Any ideas of products that would be comfortable for her??"
"We are adopting through foster care. He’s almost 2 and we’ve had him since birth. Both me and my wife are white and our soon to be son is black. What advice do you have? What’s something I wouldn’t ever think of? 
Obviously it’s going to have its challenges. Such as why many in the world see him as a threat, something I’ve never experienced. How to dress especially at night. How to deal with police officers. Why people call him ‘wthe N word. What am I missing?
Also, anyone have good communities to point me to on here?"
"I just found my daughters social media account on Facebook. It's only 3 hours old and it does not have compromising information on it, just a name and a pic of our dog.

She is only 12 so she definitely lied about about her age to open the account and she didn't ask for permission to open an account so we havnt had any real talk about the dangers of social media...

That being said I would probably be tuned out and labeled as an over protective mansplainer if I tried walk her through the dangers of comparing her life experiences to that of the fabricated or over polished experience of peers she will see.

I'm really torn between sitting her down and trying to have a good talk about social media and then letting her keep the account on a trail basis or just telling her no for now with a promise to revisit in 2-4 years."
"My 1 year old is walking (almost 13 months). I want to find him a pair of shoes . Especially for the yard.
I measured his foot at 4 5/8” 
according to a shoe size chart that is a size 5 foot.
Do I get him that exact size. Or do I get a 6? 
Also shoe recommendations? Velcro or slip.
It’s hard becuase I can’t bring him to a store for obvious reasons, so I’m ordering online
Thank you"
"Hello there, let me give you a little bit of a backstory. Me and my husband used to be very busy, working until late nights, we were living  in an Asian country after all. We didn't have much of time to spend time with our son and so we left him in the care of a helper or nanny for most of the day. That turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes we ever made.Recently we emigrated to America because of my husband's work situation, and when spending time with our son who was 13 years old of age now, I was taken aback by his manners. He treats everything for granted, he doesnt bother to put in effort for anything except games, he gets upset when there re things not going his way for trivial matters, and he is in my opinion a bit immature for his age. He is extremely afraid of exploring new things, cant withstand hardship, and anti-social. i know he has a lot of good things too and I realise there is huge potential in him but sometimes he really gets on my nerves especially his lack of effort. I know it is our fault that he became like this and I'm trying to spend more time with him now but I cant help but feel stressed in home for so long. I really shouldnt be badmouthing him behind his back but Im just exasperated and want to know how to be a better parent"
"I have an adorable 5 year old son. We live in Hong Kong, so not an English environment.  I speak native English and his mom speaks some English but mostly Mandarin Chinese.  I am trying to speak to him in English but he lacks the basic foundation. So when I try speaking to him or reading to him in English he gets very frustrated.  I am looking for websites, Youtube channels, iPad apps, videos, movies, etc, that might be sufficiently educational for foundational English but kid-friendly enough to grab his attention. He watches some PJ Mask and Peppa Pig but I think these are just going over his head. Any ideas? Anyone got experience teaching a young kid the basics of English when he just isn't interested in learning?"
"I know that this is not an unpopular opinion. I have a newly 4 yo and 2 yo, both active little boys. Not only are they active, they are barnacles. 

I am working from home, my husband is a paramedic. I count my blessings every single day. We are healthy, we have paying jobs, we have family help when needed (we just spent a month at my parents so I could work and keep the boys safe). 

I just wish they could play alone for 5 minutes. Or sit and watch tv without making noise. There is a constant stream of sound coming from their mouths...some talking, some yelling, some singing, some just noise... and they have to be touching a part of my body with theirs at alllll times. They push their chairs at the kitchen table as close to me as possible and then climb to try to sit in my lap to eat. 

I know this isn’t forever. I know they will grow and lock themselves in their rooms. Some day, they will be embarrassed to know they watched me poop. (My littlest hands me a tampon every time I sit on the toilet). But today, I want some quiet before 8:00 pm"
"We have a 4 year old nonverbal autistic daughter that is also extremely wild. She has insane climbing abilities and likes to cause trouble.

She has been turning the water on the kitchen sink and turning the faucet around (its on an island) so that it floods the counter and floor. We usually catch her but sometimes don't. She knows she is not supposed to do it but beyond putting her in her room (we have locks on all the doors now) we don't know what to do.

We initially turned off the water to the sink but were told that would eventually destroy the plumbing in the sink. So we had a wooden thing constructed so she couldn't turn the sink around.

She can't turn the sink around, but now she is grabbing whatever she can find to hold water and using that to fill and then dump water on the floor.

Is there any way to turn a sink on/off safely or childproof a sink so a kid can't turn it on? This seems like a major oversight in home design."
"Alright Reddit parents, I’ve got a weird one for you. My son is 18 months old and has a super weird quirk. 

When he was an itty bitty baby and was especially tired, he would sort of hum himself to sleep. Mostly in the car, sometimes while breastfeeding. 

But now, literally every car ride, he is doing the constant UHHHHHHHHHHHHHH groan. It’s almost exactly the Tina Belcher groan. On. Every. Exhale. 

He is not in distress. He’s not even tired when he’s doing it now. His emotion is purely neutral. I’ve tried louder and quieter music. Snacks and no snacks. Books and no books. Water and no water. Socks and no socks. Blankie and no blankie. 

And if I talk to him, he’ll groan between responses. It is literally constant until I park the car and then he totally stops. 

Am I completely alone here? Does anyone else’s kid do this? Any ideas how to make it stop? It’s driving me batty. 

He is a smart and silly little boy. No sensory issues, and by all accounts, perfectly healthy. Just quirky?"

"Advice needed! 

My ex and I broke up when my LO had just turned 2. It all sucked very much. I was extremely ill, in hospital, then 6 months later it turns out that my LO was unwell too and had to have surgery. He then had to have nurses come to our house 3x a week to give medications etc.

In the year after ex and I broke up, he immediately moved hundreds of miles away (I understand that he wanted to be near his family again that’s cool), he didn’t have a job for the first 5 months but was sitting on a (very) comfortable amount of money; so he had the time and resources to come and visit his son but only came up 4 times in a year. He was unable to have LO stay with him until just after LO turned 3 because of the medical situation etc. Oh and I had to beg him to come up to be with his son for his operation.

He’s now wanting to come and get LO and have him for extended periods of time (I think the idea of 2 weeks was thrown around). I do not have an issue with him going to stay with his Dad, I definitely want my son and his Dad to have a good relationship. My only issue is that he seems to have forgotten that LO is a person, with feelings and emotions etc. I have practically not spent a single day away from my boy. He has had the very occasional sleepover at my sisters (though once he even got so upset I had to go fetch him - and that is my sister who he sees every week at least once). 

I tried to explain to my ex that he needs to build up his contact. Come to visit, stay nearby, have him 1 night at first, the next time 2 nights etc, see him on a regular and consistent basis before he takes him away from everything and everyone he is comfortable with. I even said that if I wasn’t unwell I would bring LO to him and stay nearby him to help with adjusting (I’m still too ill to travel just now though). It has been 18 months since the split and he’s visited about 5 times. But I can’t seem to get it across to him that he needs to think of our son when he’s arranging seeing him. It would break his heart to be torn away from me so suddenly for so long. And I would worry that it would really impact his mental well-being.

My ex thinks I’m saying this because I don’t want him to see LO which is absolute not the case. If he had kept up a consistent and regular visiting schedule since we broke up we wouldn’t be in this predicament. 
He even let LO down at Xmas and decided 3 days before he was due to visit he had changed his mind.

How do you know when a 3 year old is ready to be away from home for longer than he ever has been? How long is too long for a 3 YO? How can I help his Dad try and see things for what is best for LO? I’m getting so upset thinking that he’s going to ignore LO’s feelings and just do what he himself wants.

Any help would be appreciated."
"My daughter has been asking for a trampoline for the last several months along with, to a lesser extent, my other kids (9,10,11 years old).  I have resisted because everything you read says do not get one, that's mostly the advice of doctors.  However my wife grew up with one and her and her siblings loved it and said it got a ton of use.  My daughter kids with my by pointing out all the trampolines we pass and talks about ""how much fun they must be having"" and I am surprised at how many there are when you really start to pay attention.

What are your thoughts?  I'm assuming that the doctor comments are based off what they see (injuries), but would be the equivalent of asking a plumber if you should finish your basement.  Most of the ones I have seen have seen too many nice basements ruined by water damage.  

Anyways, thoughts?"
"3.5 year old daughter was an early everything (talker, walker, she even came to the world 2 weeks early) but recently she started stuttering a lot. She’s never done this in the past, she has problems with W, I and M. Any word that starts with these letters she had to repeat 2-3 times, examples “w where where is my blanky?” It’s not coupled with any twitching or muscular spasms. Its been tough at home, my husband and I both work FT and have demanding jobs, we also have a younger child and we’re suddenly left with no help so it’s been stressful. I’m asking this with a lot of embarrassment and shame, wondering if my agitation /stress caused this? We follow a gentle parenting approach , but recently with the added stress that life has thrown our way, I now yell at least once a day.  Its usually when she hurts her younger sister which she does daily now that they’re both home all the time. Any insights or experiences with stuttering will be greatly appreciated by this worried mama. 

TLDR: is my stress / yelling causing my child to stutter?"
"Years ago, I was watching tv one night and thought of the name Elliott, and thought it was such a great name for a baby boy. So when I became pregnant last year it was up there on my list of baby names. When my fiancé and I would discuss potential names we always came back to Elliott so a couple months before his due date we decided that would be his name. 

Well, two days before he was born I suddenly had the urge to name him Oliver. I told my fiancé and he ended up talking me out of it and we went with our original plan of Elliott. Weeks after holding him in my arms he still felt like an Oliver to me. I told myself his name will grow on me. Now he’s almost 5 months old and still feels like an Oliver to me... 

I feel like if we change it everyone will think we’re crazy. There’s nothing wrong with the name Elliott, I still think it’s a great name. It just doesn’t suit him and I find myself calling him nicknames like “baby” or “sweetie” to avoid calling him by his real name. Also all our family and friends can’t get the spelling right. They’re constantly spelling “Elliot” or “Eliot”. Ughh I wish we could have time to name our kids after holding them for a few weeks rather than a day or two."
"How do u do it? Multiple kids and staying organized. 1 year, 7, 9 and 13. I'm failing at bedtime. I feel like I'm drowning. I need structure, I just don't seem to be getting anywhere. I Pinterest but I often 'pin' more than I 'terest'... Any good tips please ."
"As the title says. My daughters best friend past away of cancer and my life has become hell since, looking for advice from parents who’ve gone through something similar. Real advice. Please no comments about religion. Child who passed away was one year older."
"I'm currently struggling with this idea a lot lately, and my thoughts here will probably be all over the place so I apologize.

I'm a 24 year old single father of twin daughters that are almost 3. Their mother and  I are still really good friends, and she currently lives with her boyfriend. 

I just can't seem to get to the stage in a relationship where I'm comfortable introducing a new woman to my daughters. I honestly don't know what it is. If its a mental block, or if that's a sign of commitment I'm not ready for, or what. 

I'm currently seeing someone now for the last month or two, and before we officially start dating I would like to see how she is around my daughters. But also, I don't want to bring someone into my daughters lives who won't be around. So like, I cant figure out this balancing act and its already been the end of a couple different relationships I've had.

So if there's anyone out there who is going through or has gone through this and has any advice on this part of parenting it would be greatly appreciated."
"I’m not sure if this is the right place but my sons dad wants to get him life insurance through his job. We aren’t together so I asked if he could email me the paperwork so I could go over it. Is this the right call instead of just giving him our child’s social security number? He’s not involved in our sons life so I’m a bit hesitant. This is the same person who carries his social security card in his wallet(which he has lost). I just don’t want something happening and it affecting our son in the future.

Edit: we are both young, 19 years old"
"Sorry this may offend people but I’m not here to ask about myself—just how to approach with my child.  Thanks in advance for your help! 


I live in a legal state and smoke because I am extremely high strung and it helps me calm down.  I have a 10 and 7 year old and they go to a private school across state lines where I wouldn’t want them talking about what goes on at home because I’d prefer to stay away from those conversations with school.  My conservative midwestern parents would die in a panic if they knew about my life choices and therefore we have kept it away from our kids as much as possible.  Don’t smoke when they’re home during regular life but I have been smoking in a secluded place while they’re schooling from home to keep myself calm, etc.  despite my best efforts my 10 year old has caught on and tearfully believes I’m smoking cigarettes and will soon die of lung cancer.  

I think it’s time for a conversation with her but I want to discuss it in a way that is best for her.  Does anyone have any advice?"
"Kids are 5 and 7. Grandfather had been in hospice care since mid March, they knew he was sick and was not going to get better. With the covid situation they were not able to visit him at all in the hospicr center, so its kind of like one day he just wasn't home any more and I don't want them to think that he just disappeared.. This is going to be their first real experience with death. My father actually passed when kids were 2 and 3 months, but they were young enough to not remember the funeral or viewing. I don't want to freak them out, but I do want to pay respects and say goodbye and that this is a natural part of life. They will be going to the funeral, but by then the casket is closed and I think for them it will be just burying a box if they don't see that he's in there....Do you think they are old enough to attend the viewing?"

"My 2 youngest kids (3m and 6f) are constantly at each other all the time. My 3 year old boy in particular is very naughty and hyper and the typical 3 year old. 

A little personal background: I have 2 anxiety disorders and grew up in a very tense household due to a brother with ODD trying to severely hurt me from when I was about 12 till 22. I didn't have much back up from parents. All I know is tension. I don't want the same for my own family. 

I am full-time SAHM and do probably 90% of the work with the kids and household due to DH's shift work.  

All day I hear yelling and screaming and fighting. I eventually tip over and just do the thing I hate most back, yell and scream to try and control it. My kids listen way more to their father who pretty much is the same as me at tipping point. For whatever reason he comes across as more authoritative than I do. 

I don't want to be a push over parent, and I know there are going to be bad days (I have a 13 year old too so it isn't my first rodeo, I get it), but there has to be a better way.

I have a lot going on other than this, and my anxiety is just horrible right now. But I was just hoping that if I alleviated this issue in a more positive manner that it could take a lot of the personal torture I feel off myself and even my kids. My heart literally feels like it is just going to stop sometimes.

If anyone has some links, videos, resources whatever that they could direct me to, I would appreciate it beyond belief. 

Thanks in advance"
"My gfs 2 yr old came to the bed just now, wanting to tell her mom something just to find her sleeping again. My gf has been feeling sick for the past week or two, usually sleeping within an HR or 2 of her daughter waking up. Today was no different but she became really upset. I tried to hug her but she just ran off. I waited a couple of mins only to find her in the bathroom kneeling and crying. I consoled her and explained to her that mom hasnt been feeling good and I explained the whole covid situation to her. She gave me a hug and just went back to the living room and handed me her tablet so she could continue coloring. 

I was wondering what else could have I done? She's nonverbal still but understands very well"
"I just. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this but I feel like I'm ready to go full on Joker and just laugh until I start crying. My wonderful 7yo son is driving me insane. 

I know this situation is as hard on him as it is on me. And I'm doing my absolute best to put things into his perspective. I'm going to school full time in a very difficult course, work 10 hours a week at my internship and am now facilitating his virtual learning. (I'm not teaching, his teacher assigns grades work through Google classroom. I just need to make sure it gets done because 1st graders aren't just going to do the work without supervision.) I'm balancing a lot right now and with final tests and projects coming due, it feels like so much more. 

He has basically refused to do anything at least twice a week. He's purposely starting arguments and refusing to drop them even after I've walked away because I can tell I'm getting angry and I really don't want to be angry all the time. Everytime I tell him no to anything he's asking to do or refuse to answer a question about what he can do later (because he gets off track and getting him back to work is extremely difficult) he refuses to do anything. He's doing everything in his power to drag like 2 to 3 hours of work into 8 or 9 so I'm unable to do anything else. I've tried taking away priveledges, I've tried a reward system, I've tried everything I can think of including explaining to him that the faster we get his work done, that it gives me time to take breaks from work and school to spend time with him doing things he likes, like bike rides and video games and reading together. I'm out of patience and quickly running out of sanity."
"His grades have been declining since a year ago.  He primarily lives at his moms so my SO (his dad, I am the step mom) had zero oversight to what was happening over there as his mom doesn’t really like to share.  Recently my SO got access to the school app which better allows him to follow his son’s grades and also attendance.

When my SO looked at his attendance there were 8 unexcused absences and 7 days where he was &gt;30 min late to class.  We know of a couple days where 1) he was sick and 2) his mom kept him from school because he didn’t like his new haircut.  But he takes the bus to and from school so we are confused why he is &gt;30 min late.

The attendance is usually on the report cards so his mom must have seen it?  And I don’t think the school cares.  So Should we just let this go?  Is this “ok” for a kid his age?  And if not whats the best approach to this?"
"I’m growing impatient with my 13 month son and scared of going to sleep. Every 2-3 hours like clock work he’s awake crying.  He goes down around 7 - 7:30 and by that time he’s exhausted. 

He’s never been a great sleeper but has progressively gotten worse with waking up every couple hours. I try to soothe him but he ends screaming louder till my wife comes in. 

I don’t know if we need to let him cry it out or if there is some other thing we need to do, but it’s exhausting."
"TL;DR:  Biodad demands his son every weekend and refuses to practice social  distancing.  Me, my wife and our baby are home to the Stepkid during the  week.  How do we solve the dilemma of appeasing Biodad and protecting  ourselves?  Am I wrong here?

I  (42m) and my wife (36f) live in a major city on the west coast.   Married for a couple years now.  In normal times our home housed my  wife's kid, aka my stepkid \[SK\] (7m), during the week and our biokid  (1m) full time (obviously).   I work from home and take care of BK all  day and take care of SK before/after school.  Biodad takes SK on the  weekends.  All was well.

Since  lockdown SK has been staying with my wife's mom as she has had the time  to do his online schooling AND we wanted to let her have time with him  while avoiding CV exposure (although her husband, my wife's dad, is  still working and exposed to around 100 strangers per day -- we thought  he was going to take time off).  FF 7 wks.  This week kid arrangements  were supposed to return back to the normal schedule.

Biodad  picked up SK from my wife's mom on Friday.  Over the weekend he took SK  to a family birthday party.  CV distancing was not being practiced and  we found this out mid-party.  With no other options, SK was dropped out  our door Sunday eve.  Crossing our fingers is all we could do.

This  week went well with SK back in the house.  He's a handful, but I  managed to take care of the baby, school SK and provide him with  activities all week, keep the house clean and even get a few projects  completed.  My wife had a hard week.  She's in the medical field,  working daily with a 3-4 elderly patients in each of their homes while  she is in full protective gear.  Other than dealing with this  kid-logistics problem, our evenings are good and we are happy.

Today,  Biodad decreed that he has the right to see his son and also that  because of his living situation and CV-disbelief/CV-fatigue he won't be  following any distancing practices.  He intends to pick his son up every  Friday, spend the weekend with around eight people (all or almost-all  of which won't be distancing themselves) and returning him to us Sunday  evening.

I have a big problem with  this.  As a kid I had asthma and I'm worried about what CV might do to  me.  I also don't like the idea of our baby getting it, but more  importantly, I worry that if my wife gets it that she won't be able to  work and we will be at the mercy of the unemployment office.

I  put my foot down.  I said that if Biodad makes the choice to expose SK  to all of these people, then he needs to take care of him during the  week as well.  We could have distance visits with SK. (I love him to  death, BTW, happy he's been back)  Alternatively, Biodad could forego  his weekend visits for distance visits and we could continue to be his  home while my wife's mom takes him weekends so we stay sane.  (My vote  is protecting the older ppl and having him here 24/7, but my wife is  desperate for weekend down time to recover from the intensity of her  job. I feel her.)

Biodad won't  change course.  My wife won't demand that he take care of SK during the  week, even stands up for Biodad's situation.  She is so exhausted that  she just wants the easiest solution: SK rotating throughout houses.  I'm  hurt at her indecision and am stubbornly fixed in my decision which is  what I think is best for the family inside THIS house -- which hopefully  includes SK.

Biodad is a good dad  normally.  SK is a good kid and as a child of a successful divorce, I  understand the importance of spending time with both parents in a civil  situation.  The custody agreement is one that my wife and Biodad made  mutually without lawyers: 50% shared custody.  Nobody wants that to stop  -- under normal circumstances.  (I'm a little bitter that Biodad  doesn't actually provide 50% of anything... more like 30%, but for the  greater good and sake of harmony I keep my mouth shut most of the time)

I see few options and I need help determining which one is actually the ""best"" and if there is an option I'm overlooking.

1. We  say fuck it and just rotate SK throughout homes.  I think it's a matter  of time before we pass CV through this system and if/when one of our  parents (or one of us) gets hit we regret this decision.
2. We  tell Biodad that we won't keep his kid from him, but if he chooses to  expose SK to all of these people then he will need to care for SK  nonstop throughout the week.  (He almost never asks his family to help  and cites his contractor job as a reason he can't take any time off)   Biodad has already flatly refused this option.  If Biodad were to drop  SK off at our house after the weekend then we could no longer allow  Biodad to pick up SK from our house.
3. I  take the baby and stay at another location.  I hate this idea.  My wife  seems to lean this way, though.  I think she thinks its the easiest  choice... but nobody has yet to figure out who would watch SK all week  and administer his online schooling.  It's some kind of ""magic"" solution  that makes no sense to me.

I  hope someone has some advice.  I feel kind of obstructive right now,  but I just want to protect myself, my family and civilization in  general.  Am I being petty for wanting Biodad to deal with the  consequences of his actions and putting SK in the middle like a game  piece?  I'm hurt because I feel that my wife would rather put us at  risk, or be away from me and baby, just to avoid putting her foot down  with her ex.  I'm angry at Biodad for buying into the conservative  viewpoint.  I'm frustrated because now, all of a sudden, my wife can't  stand the idea of having to distance-visit SK even though she only  visited him a few times during the seven weeks he was at her parent's  house."
"So funny story for the afternoon. Things go as usual
Change diaper
Bottle 
Burp
Then it begins 😳
He poops in his fresh pants ok fine whatever. Give him a dog toy fine.
Well after I get the diaper down and start to wipe (it was up his back, but not out of the diaper) the tennis ball sticks to the Velcro 🤦🏻‍♀️ so he reaches down and grabs for it pulling the diaper out from under him getting poop all on his hands and the clean diaper underneath. He then puts his poopy hand in his mouth🤢
While trying to get his hand out of his mouth and cover him up so he doesn’t pee everywhere he proceeds to pee up his face and all over the couch.
So then, I get his face wiped off and keep in mind he still has a very poopy diaper happening. 
So I try once more to get him wiped down. The minute the diaper opens he immediately reaches in it again. Getting poop all over his hand. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤢😭 it was at this point the bath happened. So he’s tired, covered in poop and pee, and now scream crying in the bathtub! He’s calm and dressed now but that all happened within 15 minutes. I’m taking a nap with him... if he falls asleep that is lol 😂😢"
"I am thinking of creating an incentive calendar for my 4YO with activities, age appropriate chores, and points for behavior. I was thinking if he meets certain number of stars/points, I will get him a gift. More points mean better gift. Has anyone tried this with their little one? Is this a good idea to do with kids?"
"We are living in a hotel at the moment. (House Fire everything is ok God is good).

The hotel for the Covid virus has limited their free breakfast.

They have muffins, cereal, a breakfast sandwich, yogurt, and bananas. 

My kids love the Muffins the nutritional value is not that bad. 

The problem is they want one for breakfast and lunch. 

I want to incorporate healthier options/different options. 

Yet it seems like Mac and cheese or peanut butter jelly ever day would be the equivalent to just giving them a muffin everyday.... 


My question 
Do I just let them have the muffin?"
"Hi, I’m almost 30 wks along here with my LO who has a Down Syndrome diagnose. One of the key features of DS is low muscle tone, leaving babies/children ‘floppy’ and rag doll like. 

I’m really wanting to be able to wear her but am concerned that the popular styles and brands won’t be comfortable for her. It will take her longer than the average child to get full head/neck control for example and I don’t want to risk her flopping, and if she has less control of her legs and arms then I’m worried the traditional carriers would just have her limbs hanging their and falling asleep/going numb and be really uncomfortable for her.

Does anyone here have experience wearing a child with DS or just low muscle tone in general? This is really important to me so I’m comfortable investing in multiple styles to accommodate her as she ages"
"So, I'm hoping that I'm just not an asshole parent but I constantly have struggled with this for years now. 

When my kids talk about video games, I cant find the capacity to give a damn about what they're telling me. I try to remind myself that they're trying to share something they enjoy with me and I should be grateful they want me to be included in what they're enjoying. It's not like I dont enjoy video games, either. 

Please tell me I'm not the only one who would rather watch paint dry than listen to their kid rambling on about something they did or saw in a video game."
"Sorry if this is rambling. I’ve tried to be concise in my sleep deprived psychoses.

My children are 7 and 8 and are 15 months apart. I love spending hoards of time with them given I have balance and am able to have time to myself and time with friends. I’m also an introvert and love time at home reading, playing piano, and sewing. We have a lot of fun outside of quarantine and are pretty laid back people. 

My husband works 24-hour shifts (firefighter). He also took on two part-time jobs, one of which is nonessential and is on hold in quarantine, so he is gone for days at a time. I know that I don’t function well under those circumstances, but I’m working from home during quarantine with no access to parks, libraries, or play dates. This doesn’t afford me much variety. We can finally go on walks and bike rides with our dog now that it’s warming up. 

I discovered a few years ago that my kids respond well when I put myself “in a time out from questions”. I just can’t handle the constancy of being asked to help with this or that and never getting time to myself when it’s day after day without a break. When they go to bed I’m exhausted. Lately I can’t sleep at night, which compounds the problem. Sleep deprivation causes me to get psychotic, and a lack of a schedule or routine really messes  with my ability to stay on track. I also have my period, so I know I’m slightly more emotional and sensitive right now, and maybe it’s even menopause. 

How do you handle taking breaks from kids when you can’t really take breaks from them? Normally I love and encourage all the cuddling, and I’m always aware they won’t want to cuddle in a few years so cherish it now. I just want to tell everyone to get the #*&lt;@ off my lap, leave me alone, and give me space. Is it terrible if I start taking 30 minutes (an hour?) at a time to myself as long as I’m available should they really and truly NEED me? Maybe several breaks each day would help me. We don’t have the option of family close by helping even aside from the pandemic. I thinking of plugging into headphones with relaxing music and reading I the sun or something that will refill my very fractured bucket. 

My poor kid is crying because I’m so sick of them responding “whatever” to each other and to me when we are talking. I think that’s a hot button word, and I just lectured my son for using it. He’s sensitive and I hurt his feelings by reacting so strongly. (I’ve apologized profusely.) Ugh!"
"There are times, maybe once or twice a month, that instead of going to my bed I slip into my son's bed for the night. My wife says I'm stunting his growth to develop independence, but am I actually? I find it hard to believe that the frequency it occurs, if it occurs, is going to influence any of that. It feels more like a sleepover. He enjoys it, I enjoy it. Literature has mentioned how not to co-sleep until recent reviews, but I find it hard to think it's considered co-sleeping at this frequency."
"I'm trying to find a gate to keep the baby out of the bathroom with the cat litter but lets a 4 year old in to use the bathroom. We have a safety first pressure mounted, and the 4 year old can't do the buttons. So we've been using a giant piece of cardboard with containers to weight it that the baby just defeated finally. This has been asked before but so long ago that none of the links work. Any help appreciated thanks!!!!"
"Sleep regression 20 months?

*Hi everyone!*

*I have a 20 month old who suddenly does not want to nap during the day and takes hours to console at night (it's been going on for 3-4 days). She normally would fall asleep no problem within a few minutes the last few months. We had some difficulty during those typical stages of infancy/toddlerhood that line up with ""sleep regression"" milestones so I looked it up while contemplating how much hair would be left on my head as I found myself wanting to pull it all out hehe*

*Looks like 18 months is a big one. But she is 20 months. And are sleep regressions ""Real""? What do you guys recommend? I have a feeling it's separation anxiety since she has been around both parents 24/7 during quarantine mixed with her budding stubborn independence. What do you guys think? Tips and tricks?*

*Thank you! Wish me luck on getting some sleep!*"
"Long story short—my daughters dad and I broke up when she was about five months old, and I moved out of state (to our home state) to be with my family for support. He had initially said he’d follow. When he did, he was in and out of jail and then prison. So, they’ve had super minimal contact, met once or twice and he’s sent a handful of cards but that’s it. 

He’s out of jail and supposedly trying to do better/be better. I don’t really want him in her life, not until I know for sure he’s done “growing up,” staying out of jail and staying employed... am I wrong for that? If he contacts me or her—is it wrong to keep that from her? She’s shown zero interest in knowing him, has never really asked about him, but has gotten a recent letter and knows at least somewhat where he’s been. I haven’t asked if she wants contact because frankly I’m not cool with her having it, not yet—I’ve been saving that conversation for whenever he gets it together. 

Anyway this is weighing on me because he just informed me he mailed her money for her birthday, and I’m obviously going to have to give it to her and tell her where it came from... I’m just not sure how much I’m supposed to share. I want to be forgiving of his life choices but not at the expense of hurting my kid when he makes another one and is gone again."
"2 kids. The oldest is 2.5, the youngest is 9 months. 

My wife and are losing our minds to cabin fever like every one else. 
We temporarily moved out of our house which had a full on backyard to a smaller apartment to for a new job. As soon as the new role started we were hit with shelter in place. Shortly after that, daycare stopped and we were up the creek without a paddle. My wife and I are both only children and our parents live far away so the idea of locking down as a family with parents (after quarantine of course) was not an option. 


After watching my folks enjoy yet another hot SoCal day in a wide open backyard on our hundreth video call, the thought of ""no really, fuck this shit"" has entered my brain and by ""this shit"" I mean sitting cooped the fuck up in our apartment where the only exercise the kid is getting is running up and down the halls. 

So, the thought of taking the family out of our apartment and over to my folk's house where they would be able to run around AND we would have family support (we're still both under the gun to be high performers at work) makes sense. To a point. 

Logistically, we would be facing a lot of issues. 

* Flying is not really an option (we think) because, well, its nearly a fight to the death to get our kids to wear a facemask for more than 5 minutes before we have to fight them again to be sure they don't touch any parts of their faces with their grubby hands. Masks are becoming a requirement for the entire duration of flights. There is also the issue of exposure even though (without testing) we suspect we have been exposed long long ago. 

* the drive from coast to coast is about 41 hours give or take - BUT there is the kid factor. The longest drive I've ever done with any of our kids has been 4, maybe 5 hours max. In a normal world the way around this is to stop every few hours for a playground break so the kids can burn off energy. Playgrounds across the country would either be shut down or a breeding ground for stuff. Lately we've skirted this issue by going to wide open industrial parking lots, I don't feel that would be a safe option in parts of the country we're unfamiliar with. 

* the drive would happen in an SUV so we're at the mercy of hotels n' motels and whatever level of cleaning/sanitization is happening (or not, probably not). Renting an RV turns out to be dumb expensive so it's kind of not an option. 

* once we arrive - because our statuses have not been confirmed we would likely hunker down in an airbnb for two weeks before we would even think of entering my childhood home. my parents are healthy now but they both have managed preexisting conditions. 

That said...is it even worth it? I estimate two adults without kids running at full steam could power through a coast to coast drive in a few days. With kids the drive would be a 5 days easily. If lockdown goes for as long as I imagine it will then the cost of a 1 week drive each way, plus a waiting period of 2 weeks would potentially be worth the 4 weeks of grandparent time. 

Suggestions? Insights?"
"I’m tired of trying. My BF(54) and I (50) have 8 kids between us and 9 grandkids. We’ve been together for 6 years and it has gotten worse. We definitely have different parenting styles. While my kids were raised to help around the house, not cuss, no drugs, no sassing back. His kids seem to have free reign. His oldest is 30 and when he brings the grandkids over he cusses them out, calls them little assholes, drinks and drives with them in the car, in general just doesn’t give a rat about hygiene either. And doesn’t pick up after them. At all. His youngest 15 is said to be autistic but has never been tested. Family skeletons say he is FAS. Either way his dad just doesn’t parent him. At all. He has to be asked over and over to shower, brush his teeth, pick up his trash etc. heaven forbid if I ask him to do something then I’m yelling at him. He’s gotten to where he will not do anything I ask. I have to ask his dad to tell him something. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells in my own home. My kids at home (23, 22, 17) all pull their weight, do chores, do their own laundry. This kid refusing to even pick up after himself. I just can’t do it any more. If it wasn’t for the kids our relationship would be great. This causes such a divide. And I hate when he automatically takes his kid’s side in something without even talking to me. What can I do."
"Dad here, this just might turn into a long post

Some back story my son is turning 5 years old in June. We’ve had issues with his feeding since day one. My primary questions revolves around eating and behavior habits.

Brief medical history as follows:

· 1st heart surgery 5 days old

· Surgery to get a tube put in his stomach for feeding due to seriously reflux issues ( 3 months old)

· 2nd heart surgery 9 months old

· 3rd hear surgery almost 3 years old

· 4th heart surgery the next day, undo the process they did a day earlier

My son is doing well in-terms of his heart condition and other issues etc. Eating is still an ongoing battle for us, for the 1st 4 years of his life he was just tube fed basically we would plug a tube so he gets his feeds overnight and then during the day as per the doctors, now  were trying to teach him to eat with his mouth more since the last 1.5 years he takes too long to eat in an average if we try to go thru all his meals it takes mom approximately 7 hours a day.

First he wasn’t even open to the idea of drinking water from his mouth it took a lot of effort to get him to do that, he still have bad reflux but now he’s off that medication.

He is still eating puree and mom is trying really hard to teach him to eat solids. He just puts food in his mouth and sits, we never knew eating is also a learned behavior (the things we take for granted) we’ve tried everything now it’s getting to the point he only eats when mom yells at him in almost every meal. As a dad im a bit of a softy when it comes to him so I don’t really yell at him but he gives me hard time as well. We had an appointment with the cardiologist this week and they are saying to put him back on the stomach feeds thru the tube since he hasn’t grown since last year. We’ve spoken with other parents who are in the same shoes and were given the same recommendations told us they just had to push thru in order for their child to eat thru their mouth, the hospital gives up too easily.

I’m also trying to address some of this behavior issues or trying to he’s gotten a bit of temper now he just gets mad and goes sit in another corner and doesn’t want to talk. He listens more to mom when it comes to when she asks him for something and that is because she yells at him when feeding him that’s the only way he eats. I really don’t want to go down that path with him just not sure what to do at this point.

Is the temper and eating a normal 5 year old behavior? If other parents have any other suggestions im really open to it and try it out with my son"
"I will be a first time mother. I am thinking of trying more products that lean towards natural it does not need to be 100% natural. I just don't want products full of chemicals and dyes. I want to breastfeed or at least try to. What books would you recommend I read? Also how would I know if Bath water to too hot? I would be shopping at target,  cvs or Amazon. My in laws may also send me some products that are Swiss or Italy since they live in those countries. What are the best Swiss, Italy and American/ Canadian products?"
"Well, title about says it all. 

I got woken up by my weather alert on my phone around 4:30am. I got up and it was storming pretty bad so I made me some coffee and did the whole southern standard of going outside on the porch and listening for a tornado and generally just watching the weather radar on my phone.

You know how coffee does and I went to take care of business, all by myself with no audience from my nosey child.

 That lasted about 30 whole seconds and the lights went out and the emergency generator kicked on. Well of course that woke the kiddo up and I swear it took her about .5 seconds to track me down. So once again I had zero dignity and had to finish with the kid not only standing there watching me but also asking me a shit ton of questions. 

Just one poop alone, that’s all I want."
"My child is almost 7. I dont feel like the answers google gave me resonated. So I am asking it here.

My child was very sweet, listened, spoke early, VERY INTELLIGENT (not a brag. She is doing fourth grade math and fifth grade reading level) and has ADHD. 

Now it is a battle to get them to follow through.

I am always patient because I know and respect the fact their brain is what it is. I have adhd too.

I will tell her once. Twice. Three times. Fourth time I will tell her I am getting aggrivated. Fifth time I give the parent stare. Sixth time its a throw down. Do what I asked or there will be consequences.

And sometimes there are consequences and they act so betrayed and surprised.

Situation A: It is over trivial stuff. Putting on socks. Writing their name on their school work. Putting down a book/tablet to eat. Brushing their hair. Picking up their coat.

They will start. And then tell a story. Or go to another room for no reason. Or pick up a toy and play with it. Or just sit there. 

What we ask is not beyond their ability.

Things that are no big deal. My emotions are known. We talk about it all the time and ask how we can help them get things done. 
A quieter room? Music playing? Are you hangry? Sleepy?

They are usually fine. They just dont follow through. 

Situation B: ""stop doing x."" They lick their lips noisily after each bite. Stop. They will say okay and do it again. Not malicious. Just oblivious. 

If we say to stop playing a key during music lesson they will do it. We say stop we need to teach you something. And they will do it again! Like no impulse control. The urge to do the thing after being told no. 


They have remorse when they mess up. They really do. They cry because they want to get things right so badly. But my words dont process unless I am showing visible anger. Stern face. Raised voice. Etc.

I need a better option. I need more ideas. I need to know why it has to come to this."
"I need advice or suggestions for how to handle failing grades. I'm a foster parent to a 15 year old. an adoptive parent to two kids, 9, and 7, and I have a biological 4 months old. (All girls) For context of our home life. 

The 9 year old doesn't care if she fails. She is very smart, but refuses to work unless someone is right next to her, forcing her. When she's constantly being forced she gets perfect scores. (But then she has an exceedingly bad attitude.) It's so frustrating! I struggle daily not to lose my temper.... This issue has been happening for maybe three-ish months now. 

We've tried removing privileges, not allowing her to play with her siblings and friends until it's done correctly, no screens, extra credit assignments... none of it seems to be making any impact.

Lately, I've been trying to challenge her to see if she is bored. She just throws tantrums and refuses to do the work. Next I tried taking her back to see if we are missing any skills. Same result, but add ""I ALREADY KNOW THIS"" to the mix. Time outs have no effect. She's perfectly happy to literally sit and use her imagination indefinitely. 

We've been homeschoolers for almost all of their schooling, and I've never encountered this issue before. Usually we can work through it. We try to make sure all discipline is positive, but sometimes we have used spankings for things that are really serious. It's very VERY rare in our house, each kid has probably not had more than three in their life, and I don't want school work to be attached to such a negative disciplinary action, even for the screaming tantrums. I respectfully request it is not suggested. 

I also want to make sure her siblings aren't effected by her choices. They don't frequently have qualms with their schoolwork. 

I'm nearing the end of my patience. We paused school for eight weeks in December when I had a baby, so we aren't near the end of our school year."
"So my 1.5 year old has gotten picky on me she loves fruits,grains, yougurt and sometimes chicken. I am working on getting her to eat vegetables again it feels like a fight. Not sure how to.be creative on this. Also she doesn't like her booster seat and wants to be in her brothers high chair. I've been letting her know she's a big girl and needs to eat at the table. I feel like some of these picky habits are from me not eating a variety of food also."
"My son is a young adolescent and has minor ESE needs. He can get hyper-emotional at times. He performs adequately in school and has come a long way in the past few years. As all of us are, he is learning the new rigor of Distance Learning. 

His school is more hands-on than other schools in our District. Teachers are doing full lessons live and interacting with the kids as much as possible, but due to time constraints they are relying on a program to record students reading that uses Machine Learning algorithms to score the student's diction and pronunciation for classwork. This allows teachers to aggregate recordings and see if specific outliers exist that need more one-on-one.

My son was reading a story in this program that was rather sad. It was a story of a father going away in the military and leaving his young daughter. During his reading, the teacher must've noticed he was very emotional and texted us to let us know he was crying. We both went in and he explained how the story he read made him very sad and emotional. Mom had to go back to working so I stayed and listened to him finish out the story, intermittently sobbing in between sentences.

Finally, he finishes his reading and hits the Submit button. About 15 seconds later, he starts wailing crying. He looks at me, red-eyed and full of tears, and say ""It made me cry and gave me a ZERO."".. how can you not be heartbroken hearing that. Apparently, he was sobbing through the story so much that the machine learning algorithm had no idea how to classify him and was forced to give him a zero.

Thankfully, this wasn't actually scored. The teacher knows he comprehended the story better than most based on his tears while reading it, so nothing will be held against him, but it really highlighted the dangers of leaving grading rubrics up to machine learning. Instant feedback is generally preferable to delayed feedback, but in this case I think he would have been better off not knowing his score."
"I've wanted to get a wooden outdoor playset for my kids, one that has swings, a tower to climb up in, and a slide, at minimum. I've been able to find a small handful of ones on Lowe's website, but every other online retailer I look at wooden swing sets on has them out of stock, even online retailers that specialize in swing-sets. All I can find outside of the scant few at Lowe's is super cheap metal swing-sets, or insanely priced commercial ones. 

I'm just having a hard time finding any place that has them in stock. I'm not against buying off Lowe's but I like to shop around first and get something that best fits my kid's likes. (6 year old girl, 11 year old boy)"
"My twin boys (now 19) made this a rule about 5 years ago. It came up in conversation today and we reminisced about all the times they got off lightly because their behaviour, while wrong, was hilarious. 

The incident that created this rule happened at school. On arriving home, #2 told me I might get a call from a teacher. At this point #1 is already sniggering and I asked #2 to explain. What came out of my child's mouth was impossible not to react to even if #1s barely controlled giggles hadn't escalated into peals of laughter with occasional snorts.

Some of their classrooms had recently installed smart boards which could connect to various devices including the latest laptops used mainly by staff. My son had found himself using one of these laptops during their IT class and had not only managed to connect to a random smart board in a year 7 (age 11) class but also streamed Frankie Boyle's top ten most offensive jokes for 3 minutes until the teacher could disconnect him. 

I'd love to hear your moments of disbelief and hilarity or the rules that yours have put on you as parents."
"      Our 8 year old was up again and this time she was afraid and didn’t want to be alone.  We’ve been letting her sleep on a camping mattress beside the bed, but it really hasn’t helped.  We had some discussion about taking the flashlight and looking under the bed and such, but she kept coming back to “I’m afraid.  I want someone to be with.”  Sometimes... resistance is futile.  I agreed, but I said I’m coming to meditate. 
      I followed into the bedroom, but went on the dressing room side of a divider wall and sat on a bench to meditate.  “OK... let’s chant AUM against fear.  Chant loudly to fill the room (and we did).  Now let’s chant softly to fill our energy bubble (and we did).  Now let’s chant silently with our breath.”  Ten minutes later, I had enjoyed a short meditation and there was an eight year old fast asleep."
"I know it seems impossible to believe, but I had this parenting a toddler thing figured out... I had a great daily routine, great diet (for her and me), great planned activites, a great career, etc...

Then this virus hit and I am in a state that is in the top three for cases. This is week 6 or 7 of the official stay-at-home orders, but I started 2 weeks before. Storytime, gymnastics, dance, children's museum, ceramics diy shop, swim, zoo, heck even the park is gone. We also did a ton of what we do now - baking, crafts, coloring, academics, etc... and thankfully we have a little jungle gym in our backyard...but... it isn't enough for her. She is obviously bored and honestly, I fight with bad coping mechanisms myself right now as well. So I find myself yelling just to even get her attention.

I used to hardly ever yell (once every 2-3 months), but this past week or so...it has been everyday and I am honestly failing at parenting right now...I also am having a hard time trying to be better, because it is hard to find inspiration and something new when you are literally on maybe a quarter or eighth of an acre all day, every day with really no end in sight to at least inspire motivation. Not to mention pretty much any product kid related has at least a month lead time right now, so I can't really bring something new and exciting into the house.

So what are you all doing to get through?"
"I have a 10 yr old and left her dad before she was born because he was both physically and mentally abusive. I am a young mom and now that she’s getting older, I know that maybe one day I will have to tell her the truth about her dad. 

I started thinking about this because although he has supervised visitation with her- she has stopped wanting to go see him, citing behaviour that makes her uncomfortable (alienating me from her, she’s not allowed to sit on the couch but everyone else in the house is, forcing her to read alone for extended periods of time if she cannot comprehend a word or sentence - she has a learning difference btw) 

Anyway, she hasn’t been there to visit him since, but I’ve notice that she is starting to ask questions (were you married to my dad? why did you break up with him? etc.) 

I recently started therapy bc I don’t want to have that discussion with her from a place of hurt/trauma, and I found a therapist I think might be a good fit for her too so that she can have an adult  that she trusts outside of our home (especially if she has more to tell about her dad than she feels like she can share with me, although I hope that’s not the case). 

Have any of you ever had to have this kind of discussion with your child? What should I expect? 

Tl;dr I want to understand what to expect if or when I need to talk to my child about their abusive parent."
"My baby (2 years old in 3 months) is very strong willed. We are clearly entering the terrible 2’s now and my baby can understand a lot of things. We are implementing rules and stuff now and tantrums are a regular thing. 

I’m a FTM and I really don’t have any family around and my only mom friend’s baby is 3 months younger than mine. I’m not really sure at this age how much my child can comprehend, since speech is delayed (she does say words but started late and needed some help from Early Steps to get her talking, it’s been a great help). Not knowing how much she can understand makes discipline difficult, as I’m not really sure what to do when she has meltdowns. She will hit me and if I try to say “Ouchie no hitting!” She hits me again. At that point I hold her hands and say “Arrow you cannot hit me.” Typically she will throw herself on the floor after this, hit herself in the head and face, headbutt anything near her. 

What I do varies on the severity of the meltdown and the mood my child is in. If I think she can be talked down I’ll talk her down. If she is hurting herself I will either put her in her bed to thrash on something soft and leave the room until she is a bit calmer or if I feel like she can be talked down I’ll hold her til she calms down, like I said it depends on my kid. 

So how did you guys start implementing rules and boundaries? Is now even an appropriate time to start with that? 

Please be nice.

Signed,
A very confused momma"
Stupid society and it's requirements for modesty. If my kid could just let it all fly he would be 100% potty trained right now and I would have a lot less laundry to do.
"12 year old son asked me if we could get a present for his friend Connor at school. I asked if him Connor was having a party or something. He said no, but he wanted to buy Connor a hoodie because Connor didn’t have any warm clothes (we are coming up to winter). He said he wanted to do it for Connor’s birthday so that he would have something warm for winter but have it not be weird for Connor because it’s his birthday.  

Not sure where this little man got his sense of empathy from. I’m much more of a social clod than he is. He’s always been a kind child, but the understanding of shame and embarrassment for someone else is more astuteness than I had at his age (or indeed, as an adult)."
"I will start of by saying I should be grateful for their help during this COVID period. But as a parent, I should have some control over what my son should and should not do/have.

We live in a condo unit with 3 bedrooms. The grandparents who come over occupy one of the guest bedrooms. Too often, do they just lay in the bed with my son, while the grandmother chants inaudible prayers in her native tongue, the grandfather most likely sleeps. My son is most likely watching screen time from the tablet. He is probably wedges between them.

I have told my told countless times to encourage them to come out to the living room, watch him play, read him a book, or teach him something of value in life. But there is no effort after my request, and in the past, in know the grandparents don't take likely to my demands.

My son is only 21 months. How do I go about dealing with this issue?


UPDATE BASED ON FEEDBACK:

I guess I haven't painted for any of you on Reddit the full picture of every little  or account of the situations besides laying in bed with the screen. There are a lot of other events that bothers me that doesn't enrich his growth especially while he enters the terrible twos era.

I HAVE done my research and some say it's not healthy...are you telling me to just ignore it? Like you want me to just accept the fact that he is being fed salty, sugary crackers? Not given water? Eating non-organic foods? I'm doing my best and my part to ensure my son gets the best options possible, that I can give.....

But clearly I will have to just suck it up given the fact that so many of you here are giving me negative points and just telling me to just cram it. I thought j could get some decent parental advice and if other parents have faces the same issues...."
"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but the dentist is closed and I guess the pediatrician has better things to do than email me back about teeth. 

My 8 month old baby recently had a well child check up, and the pediatrician recommended starting to brush the baby’s (two itty bitty ) teeth twice a day with a soft baby toothbrush and water, making sure to brush after the last bottle of the night. 

My first thought was that this sounded simple enough. In practice though, HOW? 

The only way she falls asleep at night is by taking a bottle while drowsy. I wiggle the toothbrush in there and she wakes up, goes crazy, and is turned up for hours, and then needs another bottle. 

I don’t want her brand new teeth to suffer, but sleep is hard to come by and bedtime is already an ordeal. If anyone has any suggestions or advice I’d appreciate it."
"I want to start off by saying I love my son and I’ve loved the extra time we’ve been able to spend together but I think we’re both going a little crazy.

He’s 6 and an only child. His father and I are not together and his father remarried. My son is with me Tuesday night through Saturday morning. Otherwise he is at his father’s Sat-Tues.

I’ve been WFH and he’s been remote learning 1st grade since mid-March. We’re struggling to say the least and I don’t know what to do. He has no siblings to play with and really misses his friends. Like any other 6 year old boy he has a ton of energy.

Every day we’re home together is tiring from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep. He hates playing alone and is constantly asking me what to do next. I give him 20 different things he could be doing. He’ll pick something for 5 min and then be right back at my side asking what to do next.

He’s used to always having someone to play with at his dad’s because his dad has him weekends or days he isn’t working. I work on the phone where I have to speak to one customer after another and can’t have noise/distractions in the background. I’ve shortened my work hours on days he’s with me to give him the attention he needs/deserves. Still does not seem to be enough for him.

I feel like I’m failing as a parent. All day I spend frustrated that I can’t get any work done because my son can’t find something to do. All day he spends bummed out that I can’t play with him or pay full attention to him. I feel like I’ve tried everything to keep him busy and nothing works longer than 5 min.

His father and I have agreed to limited screen time so plopping him in front of a device all day isn’t an option. What are other parents doing to keep their kids busy and HAPPY? Especially parents WFH without a spouse or SO to help.

This mama is sick of crying every night because I’m struggling to juggle mom, employee, teacher, and entertainer.

EDIT: Spelling &amp; grammar"
"Hey guys, my MIL and grandmother to our two children m(2) and f(2 months) is moving to the same city as us after divorcing her husband.

We have a good relationship so I’m not too worried about us, what I am worried about is what it is going to be like for us in terms of the kids. Of course it will be lovely for them to have their granny in such close proximity, but recently as my son has hit the terrible twos, he has been a NIGHTMARE every time she has visited. She is softer than we are and generally doesn’t have many boundaries, so we have to work extra hard on parenting when she’s here. There’s always tantrums and they are much worse than usual. 

So I was wondering if anyone has been in the same boat and has any tips for how to manage when granny becomes a part of the children’s daily life so that we don’t have to deal with little devils EVERY DAY (or every day they see her). 

Any advice would be appreciated!

Tl;dr: grandma is moving close to us and we need tips on how to manage the extra tantrums that arise when she’s around!"
When did everyone's children start talking? My little girl will be 2 in September and hasnt started talking yet she was a very early Walker and will make sounds but no proper words just yet
"Our neighbor has an obnoxiously loud aftermarket exhaust and takes his car out each night around 10 p.m. and sometimes later. When started, particularly when the car is cold, the roar of the exhaust jolts our 8-month-old from his sleep. We’ve tried addressing it with the neighbor but with little success. 

We know the importance of sleep, especially for an infant. To this point, we have tried using a white noise machine and have added heavy curtains to at least try and dampen the noise. Nothing seems to help. Any suggestions?"
"That is the situation i am in. I am supposed to get my daughter two days a week for three hours a day, and every other weekend. But i haven't been getting her during the week because i totalled my car in February and have to get rides everywhere and so far I've only gotten a consistent ride to get her for our weekend visits. 

Its nicer out now and i live just under a quarter mile away from her dad. He will not, under any circumstances, bring her to me. He hates me. So with that in mind i was thinking about walking up there and having her walk back with me. I have a 3 year old who would be in the stroller, and when we walk around the neighborhood for fun they take turns. 

For some reason making her walk from her dad's house feels different than a stroll through the neighborhood or a walk on the trails behind my house.

So what do you think reddit? We would have to cross one busy road and then the rest are residential.

**Edit: oh my god im so stupid. Its a mile not a quarter mile. It takes me 15 minutes to walk a *mile*. I dont know why i was thinking it was only a quarter mile**"
"Hi. I was looking for unique names to give. Hopefully for a boy. I wanted to give a unique hawaiian name if anyone had an idea.

"First of all, what is the different between a nanny and a babysitter? I’m going back to work outside the house for the first time since my son was born in a few weeks and we are going to be interviewing people next week and making our decision on Friday. I am very nervous because it will be the first time having a stranger watch our child but I am looking forward to finding someone trustworthy to help us so my husband and I can work on our careers. 

What are some tips for interviewing potential nannies? What are some warning signs to look out for? Do most babysitters/nanny plan on working long term? Would I be out of line to install cameras in our house if we feel something is weird? What is typically required of a nanny to do?"
"I’m a mom of 3 and my youngest is just awful, as the title says I just feel like throwing in the towel. 

Let me preface by saying none of my 3 kids are perfect or even close to it, we all have our flaws. 

My older two are overall respectful, they don’t always like their chores but they do them without attitude. One is an honor roll student (school comes easy, he’s lucky) and the other is an average student who tries very hard and really earns the grades. Neither one of them have been in much trouble, they have bad days though. The worst would be the oldest was suspended in middle school for one day for him and his friends creating a group using school iPads and posting memes in said group that were not appropriate humor for school. The other child got in trouble 4 years ago for not doing school work because it was “too hard”. We discussed it and she busts her butt now, school is still hard but she tries hard. 

My youngest has my head spinning, wondering if some kids are just born “bad”. I just don’t understand what is going on. He’s in 3rd grade. In an effort to make this shorter I will just talk about things that have happened in the past year...

Caught taunting/hurting animals: throwing football or hitting baseball towards horses/goats, calling dogs or cats to him and then throwing water in their face, sitting next to dog while watching TV and I catch him bending the back leg in a way it shouldn’t be bent. He likes to pull legs off various bugs and watch them try to walk with fewer legs. He’s not allowed to be alone with any animals now. 

Three times found evidence of playing with fire, denied every time and tried to convince me that someone snuck into his room and lit matches under his bed and someone was framing him by burning his Uno cards under his bathroom sink. 

Stealing other peoples holiday candy (many many times) after eating all of his and then lying about it. Found the evidence in his room and he just flat out denies it and says he doesn’t know how it got under his bed. 

He gave a boy at school a black eye because he was holding the basketball and it was against the rules so he jumped on kid’s back and repeatedly hit the ball and kid’s face until kid let go of ball. 

He had an old iPhone color (no service) to play games on, I check all the kids electronics it’s a rule that I always have access or it’s cut off immediately. Checking his phone I see he made a video of him pulling his pants down “for the girls”. When confronted he acts like he doesn’t understand why I’m mad because “I didn’t post it! I can’t post on YouTube!” I honestly don’t know where he got that idea from, I use parental controls and my oldest son is gay so I know he didn’t see or hear him making videos for any girls. His sister still plays imagination with LOL Dolls. I’m genuinely at a loss on this one. Also had videos of him jumping on the phone and throwing the phone trying to break it. 

I’ve found my jewelry in his room. He doesn’t know how it got there. 

He’s come home from school with a nice (for a kid) watch. Someone gave it to him. I told him to give it back. A couple months later I found it in his school desk. 

He’s a very manipulative child. We were at a game his sister was cheering at and I over heard him telling someone that works at the school “I can’t play baseball because I have to stay home and take care of grandma so brother and sister can do cheer and track and field.” Not true, he can’t play baseball because of the videos on the phone, that was the punishment as well as losing the phone. 

In the beginning of the school year we took him away for a long weekend for his birthday, just him. He missed two days of school and his teacher made him a make-up packet. He told me that he finished it at school. Report cards came and he’s almost failing! Turns out he’s throwing his make-up and homework away. I didn’t have a way of knowing because his school doesn’t do agendas and the only homework kids have is class work they don’t finish in school. 

I’ve heard him say things to other kids like “I don’t care, I’ll just tell everyone you did it and they’ll believe me.” Sadly, it’s true! I feel like our immediate family are the only ones who sees the real him, everyone thinks he’s an angel and you can’t tell them otherwise. 

Yesterday the kids were working on their school packets and he comes to me and says “I finished this much so I’m not doing anymore today.” I don’t roll that way and I let him know that he was way out of line, he doesn’t get to tell me what he is and isn’t doing. So I told him that he just earned the reward of sitting at the table and finishing ALL  of his work. He later said he was done and I said I would check it tomorrow and we could fix/go over anything that was wrong or he didn’t know. I felt bad, it was a lot of work but he needed to learn a lesson, so I figured I would give him a break without him knowing I was giving him a break by checking the work tomorrow. Well, today came and I find out he didn’t do ANY further work! We were doing pizza and a family movie tonight so he did his school packet instead. 

These are just some key points, this is a daily struggle. This behavior has been going on since he was two (I’m not joking, he started stealing when he was 2. He would get up in the middle of the night and steal everyone’s phone and play until they were dead.) He’s entitled, rude, disrespectful, manipulative, he’s mean to animals and other kids. He truly thinks that he should have the same rights as any adult. If I allow him to do something once he automatically assumes that he can do or have whatever it was forever now. I have to specifically tell him things like “Just because I said you can have a popsicle now doesn’t mean you can have one whenever you feel like it, you still have to ask.” Or “I know grandma said you can watch her TV but that doesn’t mean you can come over anytime and just change the channel on her, you have to ask.” If I don’t say that he always says “Well, it was fine before.” 

I’ve tried rewarding him for being honest and making good choices. I’ve tried spanking him. I’ve made him throw away all his toys, TWICE. Manual labor. Sitting down and trying to talk to him. I’ve tried taking him and doing one on one time. Nothing works for him. 

Do you think some kids are just born bad? He reminds me of my sister when we were growing up, who has Narcissistic and Histrionic Personality Disorder. I just don’t know if there’s much I can do to help him. I’m honestly fearful of when he becomes a teen, I think everyone will be getting locks on our bedrooms doors to sleep. He actually scares me because he seems to have no currency, nothing matters enough to him."
"She insists on wearing underwear 2-3 sizes too big and wearing them halfway down her butt. She also complains about shorts and pants unless they are a size bigger than what she should be wearing. 

Has anybody else dealt with anything like this or have any suggestions?

Edit: I'm not upset with her. I dont mind her doing it if ultimately that's how she wants it. I just want her to be comfortable."
"Oomph, I’m at a loss. 

My 17 month old used to love baths.  She was never a huge fan of having her hair washed, but always tolerated it.

The passed couple of attempts have been hell. She will not sit down for the life of her and would scream bloody murder.  

What the heck do I do? I’ve heard maybe showers would be better, but my SO and I aren’t comfortable with slippery showers quite yet. 

We have toys, but clearly need to find more enticing objects? I have no idea.  I tried going in with her but that pissed her off even more. 

I can settle with a towel job for now, but her hair is just gnarly.  We live on a dusty muddy acreage, so she can get very dirty. 

Help!"
"I am considering a PT nanny to watch my 5yo son over the summer and/or while school is cancelled or in a modified format. My questions at the bottom are *mostly* regarding practical aspects.

**Context:** I have been working from home with the whole pandemic thing and tried the home-school while working for the first couple of weeks but soon realized I wasn't doing a very good job. We planned to send him to kindergarten this fall and wanted to work on getting him ready for that (we've had PreK teacher feedback that he's academically fine, but ""emotionally immature""). He really needs more structure and socialization (he's an only child).

I'm thinking perhaps just 15-20 hours a week in my home. I work at a university and could advertise with education majors, OT students, or others.

**Questions:**

* Does anyone have a generic template for a job ad and/or job description that they would care to share?
* Would prefer having a learning/fun structure versus babysitting, but I am really ignorant on any unsaid rules or culture of nannies and in-home care. What resources should I check out so I ask for what I would like and know what is reasonable (or not)?  
* Other advice?"
"My toddler is going to be 3 years old, due to quarantine all our schedules have gone trash with them (1 and half baby girl too). Anyhow he skipped his afternoon nap (from 1-3) and it’s 5:30 and I can’t find him anywhere, when I go to my room this is what I picture he did.

-went upstairs
-Turned the A.C on
-closed the door
- turn the lights off
- climb to bed

He was literally so deep asleep, I let him be (which I regretted that night.) 
I’m not ready for him to be so in charge of himself, he’s my baby and I know we must let them grow but kid don’t slap me in the face like that with those actions."
"So this is my second Mother’s Day. First year as a single mom. Last year, I was with my daughter’s dad and even though our relationship was really bad, he went out of his way to make it a special day for me.
This year, the thought kind of depresses me. I know it’s not about gifts or being spoiled or anything, but the appreciation is nice... I know that’s selfish.  My daughter doesn’t have anyone to have her make gifts with so I won’t have any homemade gifts that she “made” when she was so little and idk, it just makes me sad. 

Am being completely selfish? Are my feelings valid? I KNOW I am so blessed and lucky to be a mom and I swear I am not trying to say otherwise, but I just have a little heaviness on my heart.

Ugh even typing this out I feel like a terrible person"
My little guy is 7 weeks today and just pushed him self up on his forearms and held his head up for 2 minutes! Instead of face planting like usual he slowly lowered his head and preceded to put it back up and hold it again for another two minutes! I’m one proud Moma. My kid hates being on his tummy. He would usually lay on the mat like a baby blob and do nothing other then cry.  I was getting a little nervous because he wasn’t even really attempting to try to pick his head up. He was hiding his strength all along! This is my first kid and I am overwhelmed with excitement.
"Some background: Literally no one my child even knows can play piano. No one in my family plays an instrument, except her father who plays guitar. He can play by ear exceptionally well, but has never had lessons or reads like sheet music or whatever it's called. 
I bought my daughter a toy keyboard at a tag sale when she was 3. We took it home and put batteries in it, and she immediately figured out how to play ""hot crossed buns"". I thought that was impressive. No one taught her anything, so just kept hitting the keys until she found the ones she wanted, then strung them together. Then twinkle twinkle little star, then the sesame street theme song. I thought this was pretty amazing, and I swore I'd get her lessons, but no one around me started lessons that young. They told me to wait.
I'm a shit mom sometimes, and I never tried again, life got in the way. When she was 5, she learned to play the intro to the Tool song Schism (please don't judge, I'm not letting her listen to Tool, she walked into my office when I was listening one day and then played the song on the Amazon Echo until she could play it on her keyboard). And a few other random ""real"" songs, like a Taylor Swift song. So right before the shutdown (she's 6 now) we were going to enroll her but not surprisingly, I never got around to it. This morning she taught herself Chopsticks in its entirely, the theme song to the show Bluey, and the beginning of Moonlight Sonata. Nearly perfectly, too. We tried to watch some YouTube videos that teach piano, but she refused to watch and threw a total fit. We can't enroll her in lessons right now, for obvious reasons, and I don't know when that will even become an option again. I don't know ANYTHING about music, so I'm of no use to her. So I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas how I can encourage her, or how she can learn in a more formal/proper/normal way. And also is this normal? Is she average or is this something even worth pressing her to do? I don't really know how or when kids develop any musical talent, or how much is natural vs. learned, so I'm not really sure where we're at, or how much a 6 year old is meant to do."
"Hello,
We welcomed a baby girl 7 weeks ago. Everything is good - working from home these days gives my husband and I the chance to devote more time to her than paid leave would provide. She is healthy, sleeps well, and I think we're doing a pretty decent job for first time parents.

The problem is my anxiety. Holy cow, you guys. Yeah, I've done therapy, and it was fine until I had a baby. Now everything is, ""What if something happens to her? What if something happens to me or the husband? What if there's a freak accident/I drop her/someone hurts her/someone breaks in/we get in a car crash..."" and on and on.

The thought of anything happening to her or my husband can make me tear up. We're in our 20s and I should not be occupied with thoughts of death and mayhem, but they are persistent thoughts and they keep returning every night.

How on earth do you experienced parents manage to care for such a fragile little person without going mad with worry? Please tell me this gets easier! I don't want to be so anxious about terrible things that probably won't happen."
"Our 14m old has always been a sleeper, from day 1. These days her bedtime is 630-7. She sleeps until 7-730 am. People keep telling me that I’m “forcing her to go to bed to early” when she naturally gets tired around 6. Is that a crazy bedtime? I’m sick of our family/friends making comments on it and even saying I do it for my own selfish reasons. At first I thought maybe they were just surprised because their kids weren’t good sleepers, but I’m wondering if I should be keeping her up later? (Which seems absurd.)
Just curious and annoyed."
"Husband and I currently have one child. A 2 year old son. Since the moment we found out we were expecting he always mentioned how he wanted another one. Now he knew from the start of our relationship (been together 10 years) that I never had a huge urge to have kids and if I did maybe one. So obviously now I’m content. 

Our son will be 3 in a few months and the talks about another baby have become more frequently. I am absolutely terrified of having another one and am only considering because of him. 

Are these normal feelings? Would they go away if/when we have another one? Or would I secretly regret having another child?"
I just shampoo'd the carpet yesterday and the house is a mess. There are boxes everywhere because the virtual baby shower was supposed to be Saturday. I'm stressed as I've ever been and my wife seems to be just fine. Everyone keeps saying the same things about how I'm gonna be an awesome dad but I'm worried I wont even know how to hold him right. I have 2 younger siblings almost 30 younger cousins and even all that experience doesn't seem to make me feel better. Please reddit say something to help me calm down.
My son is mixed race and approaching 16. I want to find a way to explain some way that as he gets older he might need to be more careful. I'm worried that as he is hanging out with his white friends that they all might get into trouble or just innocent kid shenanigans that MAY have a different outcome for him. My husband doesn't want to say anything that makes our son see the world differently than he does now or for our son to have those thoughts in the back of his mind. I'm scared that if he doesn't it could be worse.
"Hello! So I guess I’ll get straight to the point. I have a stepdaughter (14). I’ve been with her dad for 8 years known her for a little more than 7. There are three kids in between us a daughter of my own (9) and a son together (6). Throughout our relationship she has falsely accused me of abuse and neglect. Now when she was young while it hurt my feelings I know it was to playcate her mother and they couldn’t prove I was abusing if I wasn’t . However it never stopped. In fact during a court case between mom and Dad last year, she called dfs and said I locked her in a hotel closet. The court case has ended and we now have much more time with stepdaughter. The accusations still abound usually to her dad or grandma. I always blow it off as well she’s mad because I’m more strict than she’s used to or made her do her homework yada yada. I do make bends in the rules for her I wouldn’t with the other kids, but I still maintain a certain set of expectations. However, yesterday I caught her telling her grandma I wasn’t feeding her and was trying to kick her out and abusing her. I literally hadn’t even seen her at all that day. I let her sleep until noon because she says she’s up until 4 all the time at home. Her grandma had called to see if she needed to buy food for us and ask what’s going on and that’s how I found out. My step daughter then proceeded to throw a huge fit, say she was running away called her dad and told him I hit her. Who then texted me, didnt ask what was going on just went off on me how I abuse his daughter. At that point I’d had enough. I told him, my step daughter, and her grandma (who we share custody with as mom is deemed unfit) that from now on she can’t be left alone with me. That her dad needs to be here and if he isn’t I need to go somewhere. At 14 she’s knows the difference and is honestly just using it to get her way. She’s done this for as long as I remember and it’s always been allowed as both sides can not stand each other and soak in any dirt about the other like it’s a life source. But I have kids this is my home and I don’t want to feel like me saying it’s time to do homework or no we don’t drink soda at ten am can get me some false allegations of abuse. I understand I let this go on too long before I stood up and now everyone is furious with me. And now I’m at a loss now I don’t even know if my decision was the right one. I know she’s frustrated. She’s 14 and she is spending a ton more time here and I don’t just let her run the show. I have tried to make bends and let her get away with extra. But I feel like my hands are tied and either I do as she says or she’s telling dad or grandma I abuse her. I let her keep her phone at bed and at dinner. There’s no real set bedtime for her, there’s no set wake up time or homework time. I let her make her own schedule all I ask is she do what she needs to at some point during her day. We do have times when our relationship is great but any time I try to tell her anything or correct her at all she flips. I’m just so confused, frustrated, and could use absolutely any insight that I can get."
"My 15 year old daughter has been raised mostly by my parents.  Her mother and I divorced when she was 4 years old.  My job kept moving around and her mother went to prison so the most stable location for my daughter was with my parents.  My job is stable and I am happily married with 2 young sons now. I am the custodial parent,  Would I be wrong to make my daughter come live with me now?  Would I do permanent emotional harm by making her move st 15? I want to spend what little time I have left off here being a child with her.  The biggest issue is I live 2500 miles away from my parents now.

Edit. 

We have always had a great relationship.  I have always been involved and talk to her daily. It isn't like I haven't been in her life at all,  she just hasn't lived with me regularly.  She had lived with me for 1 year on 2 different occasions."
"My 3 year old daughter always wants her teenage brother (15) to hold her. Then if he puts her down, she starts sobbing and throwing a tantrum. Any advice on how to curb this clinging?"
"My son is 2.5. He’s got peeing in the potty down. He lets us know when he has to pee and even he’s too distracted to let us know, we try to take him every 15-30 mins. As far as peeing, he’ll have maybe one accident. The big issue is poop! He refuses to let us know when he has to poop. Once I even asked him if he had to use the bathroom, he said no. One minute later, it was just bad. I do try to take him even when he says he doesn’t have to go, because 9/10 he will use the bathroom anyways. Is there any way I can get him to let my husband or I know when he has to go #2 the same way he tells us he has to pee? We are so tired of cleaning poopy underwear 😭😭"
"Our 3 year old son hits mommy when he’s upset. Tonight he wouldn’t eat his dinner and then demanded a banana. It was chicken and pasta, one of his favourite dishes. We said no and that he had to finish at least some of his plate. He had a temper tantrum and hit mommy. We’ve tried giving him time outs but it doesn’t seem to curb his bad behaviour. I know he’s only 3 and it’s a tough age but how do we discipline him? He’s got to learn that hitting is not okay. Any suggestions, Reddit?

Love,

Frustrated father"
"I’m looking for advice from anyone that has dealt with sibling rivalry/violence. In our case, our 3 year old is VERY rough with his older brother (5). So much so that he leaves marks on him frequently from scratches, pinches, throwing toys etc. We try to intervene when we see it coming and instantly put him in a rest (our version of time out) when it happens. Sometimes it is triggered by wanting a toy or not getting something he wants from his brother and other times he will walk up to him unprovoked and pinch him. Our 5 year old is starting to become afraid of his younger brother and it’s breaking my heart. Any advice on how to address this? Obviously our approach isn’t working."
"My mother is the definition of neglectful and selfish. As a mother myself, it gets harder and harder to even forgive - never mind justify - her behavior. 

After years of therapy and growth, I still wish I had a mother to talk to... which led me to create an upcoming project which may solve this void for many. 

As part of the building process, I’m looking to speak with other individuals that can relate to this particular feeling. It can be 100% anonymous if you want, but your responses would be used to help us structure the solution. If you’re interested in sharing your experiences and having a discussion about it, let’s talk over DM. 

I hope it’s ok for me to post this here, if not, perhaps you can point me in the right direction?"
"My son turned 3 on Monday. He is potty trained, but continues to poop and pee on his floor at nap time (he just quit actually sleeping this week) and in the mornings when he gets up. He has a potty available and he still goes on the floor. Today he pooped at nap time and then put the poop in the air vent. He can take any clothes off easily so pull-ups and diapers are useless. 

Needless to say, I’m pretty sick of it. He’s very obstinate, defiant, and overall an extremely challenging kid. Any advice for me? This mess plus his other behaviors are nearly sending me over the edge and I need help dealing with it. 

Also, does anyone else’s 3yo do this? I don’t know any others that do and it makes me worry that something is wrong with my son 😞"
"So it went a little something like this;

Me: Daughter, it’s Mums birthday on Sunday, how old do you think I’m turning? 

Daughter: hmmmmmmm, er 63?

Me: close, it’s actually 36

Quarantine has not been kind to me reddit.

Edit: I will keep my mind and eyes open as far as dyslexia goes, I don’t want to label my daughter incorrectly too young. I appreciate all the comments concerning this subject. Thanks 🙏"

"I understand its an unprecedented time, but I'm unhappy with my son's ""e-learning equivalent"" for his speech therapy.  They are only doing worksheets and giving youtube links, and refusing teletherapy via something like Zoom.  I've spoken with the principal without success.

I think I understand my rights for the yearly IEP reviews (mediation, etc), but what are our rights during these strange times?  Do I have power to challenge this further?  My son is very far behind in speech and it is impacting all areas of his life.  My son's private speech therapist is doing Zoom teletherapy, which is working great, but he really needs help from the school too.  The Illinois governor is saying next school year may be e-learning too.  What can I do?"
"First time mama and on day two of sleep training my 6 month old! It was off to a pretty good start and now I’m on day 2, I’m a sleep deprived wreck now. I just need some parents to reassure me it’s going to get easier! Not getting all that much encouragement at home, and I feel like I’m doing this all by myself.

How was it for you?!"
"He wont eat fruit, vegetables, fish, any seafood, anything like brown bread/pasta/rice, he won't drink water. I'm posting this because I spent so long yesterday cooking a nice new recipe for everyone, he just said 'I'm not eating that' and then cooked himself a potato for dinner.

He also won't 'experience' anything new. i.e, he won't go to certain countries on holiday, won't go on day trips to places we've been before, won't watch a new TV show etc.

He showers once a week, never cleans up for himself, his room is disgusting, he won't get a job no matter how many times I ask him, won't look after his cat...

I don't give him money or clean his room for him, I make him cook his own food if he doesn't like what I make. I guess you could say I pander to him by letting him live with us; but I would never kick him out to be homeless, especially at a time like this. I just don't know what to do."
"My daughter (turning 5 next week) has been in school in America as I've lived here since she was a year old. We're returning home to England very soon and she'll be going into Year 1 in September. I was wondering if children that age have started to learn to read yet?

My mother seemed to think that they have and that they're able to read their first 100 words or so and I've looked on the government website but it's not clear at what level children coming out of Reception and into Year 1 are expected to be at.

Obviously I have time to teach her and get her up to speed but I just wanted to ask if I should be concentrating on phonics and reading or if they haven't covered that yet?"
"I am very fortunate to have a loving &amp; caring husband. He’s a hands-on father and our 13 MO adores him. I’ve tried telling myself that it’s awesome that she prefers him more, I’d have more time to myself on the weekends. But that sort of argument falls short when I see how much she laughs and hugs him when she’s not at all like that with me. I’d usually have to ask for a hug or a kiss, that’s never volunteered. It doesn’t stop me from loving her, of course, but some days I cycle through the feelings of jealousy and resentment...but mostly it’s just sad. 

There are times in which I try to sneak in a quiet cry in the bathroom, she would come in and smile at me crying and ask for dada over and over. I know she’s just a baby and doesn’t understand anything yet. But, it just hurts."
"My 3 month old has mucus in his nose constantly.  Today i had to clean out his nose with an asasperat during his bottle feeding so he can breathe better and finish his bottle
 He got very upset by this, to the point of him crying very loudly. But I was able to clean out his nose and finish his bottle. Later after he calmed down I was in tears from the experience . does it get easier to hear your child cry even if its necessary to talk care of them?"
"Currently, my wife makes every meal for our one year old from scratch, using only organic ingredients. She's fairly strict on being anti nonorganic, preservatives, dyes, or coloring. Are there any good quick/on the go meals for a one year old that would meet this criteria?

Edit: She also has FPIES and can't have eggs, unfortunately :( cornerstone of my wifes and my diet."
"My name is Sarah and I'm very new to this. I have a four almost 5 year old who was diagnosed with Sensory Integration Dysfunction last year. She is currently doing occupational therapy once a week for 45 minutes. She has been having bad melt downs where she has no control. It takes her quite awhile to calm herself down. I have a brush that I use to help her relax. 

The transition from working to staying home due too current events has been harder than expected, she chews her hair when anxious,  wont sleep at night and im having a hard time with parenting this, any advice would be appreciated thank you."
"My five month old son always slept on his stomach. Now he has learned to roll to his back in the middle of the night and he doesn’t seem to want to fall asleep that way, we roll him back over to his stomach and wait there until he falls asleep but then five minutes later he will roll to has back and wake up again, any advice ? He was sleeping all night before this."
"Guys how can I go about this better? Every week I wake up my 9 year old to log on to her Zoom classes at 11am, Mon-Thurs. Well this morning I had her get in the shower while I made breakfast. By the time I came upstairs she wasn’t even logged on yet and it was 11:17 already. This is about the third time she was late. She knows how to log on easily. Today her excuse was she was still combing her hair. I yelled at her saying “you’re not on Zoom yet?!?!” She then teared up and started crying. It has also been difficult for her to do her weekly packets. Even though I tell her a time to do it she gets sidetracked and distracted and I end up losing patience as well. Our relationship hasn’t been the same since quarantine started honestly. Her father isn’t in the picture he’s pretty much a deadbeat. I’m asking for advice because I don’t like being negative like this."
"We have both used LSD back in the good old days and can't tell if that could be why that is all we hear. Maybe we're just overthinking the whole thing, but would hate for this to turn into a nickname or something like that."
"My second little boy and we in the depths of this regression. Oh I’m so tired, what does a full night of sleep feel like again?!? It’s been over 4 months since I’ve had more than 3-4 hours solid sleep. My 4 yr old started sleeping through the night by 7months so I hold some hope. Its both isolating and calm at this hour of the night. This too shall pass I know, I know but right now I’m exhausted. I feel like I’m living Groundhog Day. I’m eating my peanut butter and jam sandwich (live in Australia—become addicted to these sambo’a since breastfeeding insatiable hunger) and dreaming of that sweet sweet time I’ll sleep the night. Maybe this is my last baby after all?!"
"So, my son will be eight months in a week and I’m starting to feel a little like a failure here. I see all of my friends with babies who are even younger and they are eating puréed foods and mashed foods just fine. A couple have even started to hold the spoon by themselves and come close to bringing it their mouths. 

My son has been breastfed exclusively since birth and he is beyond obsessed with it. We started introducing puréed veggies and fruits a couple months ago and he seemed to enjoy it. Then we started doing the rice cereal (I know, a little backwards) and he enjoys that. Now, in the last few weeks, he doesn’t seem to show interest in eating much at all. I try to give him cereal in the mornings and he just spits it out at me. I try giving him purée fruits and veggies and he either gags or spits it out. I’ve even tried finely mashed fruits and he legitimately gags to the point that he almost throws up. He will even continue to gag after it’s out of his mouth, his eyes getting really watery too. I try to give him the spoon and he has no idea what to do with it. I’ve also tried putting the food in front of him on his high chair to grab himself and it’s like he has no idea that he’s supposed to eat it. He just smashes it in his hand and whines to be picked up.

He loves to chew on frozen fruit in mesh teethers and suck on fruits like watermelon and strawberries but I can’t get him to actually eat things! No matter how much we force it or consistently try he continues to gag or spit it out. All he ever wants to do is breastfeed! Accept for the rare occasions before his bedtime where he’ll eat some rice cereal. I’m trying to wean him from breastfeeding but I can’t if he won’t eat anything else. Please help!! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
"My 18mo old son has a very large vocabulary. He is able to count, identify letters, make phonic sounds, make animal noises, sing, etc. I guess I’m trying to explain that he is smart and capable, he understands a lot. 

When his father and I sit with him to give him something (sippy cup, snack, something he wants etc) we do the typical “banana, p l e a s e?” &amp; “thank you” after, but as soon as we mention the word “please” he loses it, throws himself on the floor and screams. Like a full-blown tantrum. I expected this kind of thing to happen, fit throwing is typical toddler behavior but I’m not understanding why encouraging manners just makes him absolutely furious. He sometimes says “thank you” when he’s not cued but loses interest in manners as soon as he’s cued. We tried encouraging “pp pp please” because he likes phonic sounds and it seemed to work for 5 minutes until he caught on. He’s literally relentless about it and I’m lost at what to do. I try to walk away and wait for him to calm down and try again but it’s the same thing every time or it just gets worse."
"Hi there, first time Mom here with a 1 week old who was 4 weeks early. I’m finding that her feeding is really inconsistent. Some days she takes 50 mL no problem others times it’s a struggle to get 20 mL. This is all breast milk from the bottle, because she was struggling with sucking while breastfeeding. She does have the recommended wet and dirty diapers, just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this situation and can calm my worries. Thank you!"
"My 2 years old kid always refused to sleep ever since she was stop direct breastfeeding (1year and 7 months)
It is like when she woke up at 7 Am, and took a nap around 3pm sometimes 5 pm (already prepping her to take a nap since 2 pm but it is so hard to get her to sleep) she slept for like 30 minutes, she can last till 2AM!!! 

She got sleepy, sometimes her eyes already closed and then she's like force herself to woke up and the running around or jumping up and down so she couldnt fell asleep. 
Already set the room like turn off the light, turn soothing music, or sometimes i singing her lullaby.  


Today she's woke up at 3AM Until 10 AM and then just slept for like 15 minutes and up now at 7PM!! I feel like i couldnt take it anymore. 
She's a really smart bright lil girl, she's start walking and running at 9 months,can speak two languages in 1year and 2 months, know alphabet  A-Z and number without get any wrong at 1.year and 5 month

I already talked to a doctor but he couldnt find anything on her. 

Is there anyone experience something similiar like this?"
"
So I will have my son tomorrow for the first time in a bit due to current events. My ex texted me this morning with a list of info and on it she said that my son (who is 2.5) has only been eating yogurt, macaroni, berries/bananas, and uncrustables. She said that he is always saying he’s hungry and rubbing his belly, so every time she gives him a snack. Honestly I’m a bit worried. She was saying I needed to be sure to buy those foods for my house for him, but I feel like that’s not a proper meal? Should I say anything to her? My son is a HUGE kid. He’s in the 95 percentile for height and weight for his age. He basically towers over my neighbors 4 year old. How do you guys feed your 2.5 year olds? He is not a picky eater. Usually I will feed him some of whatever I have for dinner so I don’t think he’s refusing to eat other foods, that’s just what she knows he likes and he will eat by himself without her having to cut it up or anything. Am I overreacting?"
"Hi my name is Patrick, and my first born son, who is now 5, asked me very seriously about death, and what happens after. He said ""do I still see after I die?"" and I didn't know what to say, it really threw me for a minute. He kept asking, and wanted to know what's after.. He started to tear up and get emotional, it broke my heart, I started to get a few tears myself but didn't let him see.

I told him not to worry about it and he's got such a big life, I tried to keep it positive and talk about life, saying ""do you know how long people can live for? Over a HUNDRED YEARS! That's a very very long time"". He liked that but it didn't help much and he just wanted answers about what happens after.

He got very upset and I could tell he was scared about death, so I had to figure something out. He loves Star Wars so I told him it's kind of like Force Ghosts in those movies. It instantly made him feel better, it was like I could feel a wave of calmness come over him.

It really hit me hard, me and my son have such a strong bond, and I hate to see him like that. 

Has anyone else gone through a similar thing? And how did you deal with it?"
"Just wondering what are the general reasons for babies waking so frequently during the night. 

My 12 week old will have nights where she wakes every hour after a certain amount of sleep. For example last night, she fell asleep at approx 7, woke at 9 and then 11 for feeds.  She then woke at 1am,2,3,4,5...so safe to say everyone is very tired but wondering if theres anything we could be doing to help her to sleep better.

She has 4 naps everyday. I am very aware to not let her get overtired so always start to put her down as soon as she show tired signs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I wondered could it be reflux as she does throw up a lot during the day and trashes a lot in her sleep!"
I haven't been reading to my 3 month old yet because she goes to bed before I get out of work but next week I'll be getting out early from now on. I am asking what books do you like to read to your child?
"How can I help my child prepare sth for Mother's Day and still have it as a surprise (for myself)? They get very upset when they don't have ""something"" to give me regardless of how often I reassure that I don't need/expect anything. 

(Parallel parenting situation, and I'm on my own.)"
"How can I convey to my 2 and 5 year old that it is not humanly possible for me to constantly be 1000% engaged with them all of the time? 

They play together a bit sometimes, and when they do it's great and my heart is full. But once somebody feels wronged it ends and everyone is a mess. I also live on the 2and floor of a 3 fooor apartment complex so I have neighbors above and below me. Letting them scream or work out their fights have never been an option because of this. 

My 5 year old has been obviously displaced and is missing her school friends fiercely and I think is resenting her brother a bit over it. I have been a SAHM for the entirety of both their lives and my husband has been required to work through all this chaos. 

I end up feeling bad when I tell them i need space. (Mommy please play again. Mommy i dont have other friends to play with. Or my 2 year old will just shriek. I'm overwhelmed and TIREDT."
"Hi

My baby girl is 6months old and has been a cat napper since birth. She sleeps in her crib for both night sleep and naps, however she would only ever sleep from 20 to 40minutes for naps, and on a night she would wake up every 20/30 minutes about 5/6 times before she would fall asleep for a slightly longer period of time..

So I must admit in desperation I put her to sleep on her tummy for her a nap and watched her. She slept for an hour and half without waking!

So my question is, now that my baby can roll both on to her front and back, can I lay her to sleep on her tummy? Or should I continue to put her on her back??
Any advice would be very helpful"
"Anyone else have a parrot instead of a human child? My 5 year old has started every sentence directed at me with ""But Mom, by the way"" for the last 3 weeks and if I hear it again I may lose my freaking mind. I don't even know where he picked it up? It's not something my husband and I say often. Maybe it's just quarantine getting to me, but he needs to find another way to address me. The broken record act is driving me nuts."
"Today I accidentally bumped my son's loose tooth hard enough it started to bleed a little. Later in the evening he mentioned it was still hurting.

Me: ""Well why didn't you tell me earlier? I would have given you some tylenol.""

Him: ""I didn't know! I thought it only worked for headaches and fever.""

Me: ""No, it works for all kinds of pain.""

Him: ""Does it work on emotional pain?""

I proceed to lose it cracking up ""No, no it doesn't work on emotional pain."" ....unfortunately"
"I too am scared about what kind of mother I’m going to be, I don’t want to be like my own mother. She has really bad mental health problems which isn’t her fault but it was always taken out on me, she would get so drunk and come upstairs to push me around, if I pushed her away she would fall over cause she was so drunk but shout my Dad to say I was beating her which I never did, my Dad would strangle me til I couldn’t breathe and throw me around by my neck then I’d throw up from trying to breathe again. One time was the day before my 15th. My Mum would make such rude remarks infront of my brother and Dad about my clothing she would wash, I had a boyfriend and she thought there was sperm on my clothes (there wasn’t, gross, probs make up idk) but humiliate me shouting it all around the house whilst my brother and Dad would look at me like filth. She would say I would self harm for attention. She would be in and out of hospital for suicide attempts and my Dad would always say I don’t give a shit (I was literally under 15 and had no idea how to deal with this) I got locked in the house with my phone taken away and the landlines put out. It was always trouble for them if I needed new clothes. I wasn’t aloud the same food as my Dad, he always had the nice food and I had to have the much cheaper versions, I wasn’t aloud to eat salmon or anything new because it would be for my Dad (they had the money too just they spent it on alcohol, cigs or my dads food) I went to a couple hostels and I spent most of my teenage years barricading myself in my room. When I was really young, I wasn’t aloud to play on the street with all the other kids so I would watch from the drive way, we never went the park or anywhere. I remember my Dad kicking me for dancing in the living room.. My mum would always terrorise me when drunk and my Dad would just sit there and let it happen even though I would be screaming, crying and begging for him to get her to stop, he would just carry on drinking his beer. My brother wouldn’t help, THEY NEVER WENT NEAR HIM but they did me.

I’m 21 now, mother to a nearly 6 month old and I’m TERRIFIED. I have really bad mental health, funnily enough after getting kicked out at 18 for sticking up for myself, I made contact and we made up. My Dad is so fucking racist I CANNOT STAND IT. We are a white family and we didn’t have it hard.. but he still thinks white people are so hard done too? He will never mention anything violent that’s happened to a community of other colour but will always rant and rave how white people are always hurt and “no one cares” and that he’s not racist but all black people are really stupid like what? How can you even justify that comment with something so fucking ridiculous.. he told me that if women are raped then they should keep the baby cause it’s not there fault. He told me I shouldn’t put lipstick on in public because men will think I want sex from then. I miscarried at 17, I fell to the floor crying after and he just stood there watching me pick myself back up. I fucking hate this white supremacist, sexist, vile pig. sorry, ANYWAY it’s my Mum I want a relationship with, I know she hurt me but I feel it’s not her fault cause of her mental health but with her comes my Dad cause she’s still with him even though he was watching and wanking off to porn in our living room in the early evening whilst we were upstairs (I was pregnant at the time and would be too scared to go get a drink in case he was watching it) which my Mum classes as cheating but she still takes him back. I haven’t spoke to them since February 2020 cause of a fallout shortly after my son was born, I wanted to talk to them all about the shit they put me through in my life and my Mum completely cut me off on everything I could reach out to her on.. like read the messages and that’s it so I got really pissed off and said they’re not having a relationship with their grandson and that they’re monsters then they turned that round on me saying it’s all my fault this has happened but I said I would never say anything if you just were open to talking with me about the past? ANYWAY... we’ve been speaking for a couple weeks me and my Mum and she really wants to see me and my son after lockdown but I feel really hurt, deep in my soul I feel like I’ve had my childhood and teenage years destroyed bc of them.. I have no confidence, I have no motivation, I hate myself, I believe all my failures in my life stem from how I was never nurtured or made to feel stable or secure in my upbringing. If I tell them that, they will deny it. I even told them my teeth aren’t healthy cause they never made me brush my teeth as a very young child and there response “you were 6, you were old enough to be responsible enough to brush your teeth” SORRY but what 6 year old is going to brush their teeth every night and follow a routine? I know it’s all in my hands now how I look after myself etc but I feel they’ve made my life so much harder bc I’ve developed bad habits that I’ve had for a lifetime. I was heavily involved with drink from 13 which later turned to drugs where I nearly died from taking Xanax and alcohol. The alcohol started bc I wanted to be out the house and escape on the weekends cause that’s when they would drink... I remember they refused me any of my clothes when I went to a hostel n to just rewash the ones on my back.

Sorry I’m rambling, there’s just so much shit to tell and there’s still so much to tell but tbh it’s upsetting me so... what would anyone else do in my position?

EDIT: abit more background. I am the youngest of 6. My Mums first died from SIDS when she was 16. She had another kid 2 years after who she left. Her third child she stopped bothering with when she was 12. Her fourth child, she packed up me and my brother and left to move to the top of Scotland when we were in mid England, she left his behind with his foster Carer and never provided a number or address to contact her and she never bothered getting one for him, I found him on Facebook years later, he has been in a psych ward for 6 years with paranoid schizophrenia. My 2 sisters who she basically abandoned have never had a relationship with her until very recently they’ve been messaging over Facebook. My brother who I grew up with is the golden boy, never hurt, never got harassed or mistreated and he loves my Mum but hates my Dad (my other siblings don’t share the same dad) 

My Mum split with my dad once and me, my Mum, auntie and cousin went to a hotel and my auntie and mum were having sex with 2 men on their beds, the men could see us looking at what we were doing on the bedroom balcony (the room had a second floor where you could look over at the first floor where they were) and said we were watching and my mum said let them. We were 7 and 8. I’ve always been told my Mum used to sleep with a lot of men, she even encouraged me to cheat on my boyfriends cause I was young and should have fun. 

My Dads parents never gave him any attention at all, he never used to tell me he loves me and would always be told by my Mum to hug me, he was told by my mum to apologise for him strangling me and he said he wouldn’t do it if I didn’t upset or hurt my mum then said sorry. My mum suddenly has no memory of him hurting me even though she watched it happen..

My Mum would tell me she loves me and is proud of me etc but then quickly turn to ignoring me for hours/days if I did something wrong so I would feel like I had to win it back. 

The racism really bothers me, I don’t want it rubbing off on my impressionable son who doesn’t understand. I grew up my whole life to the raves and rantings of “the bloody Muslims” “oh they’ve got black people presenting” honestly it knocks me so fucking sick, my blood absolutely BOILS and I’ve tried so hard to get it in their head that their opinion is so dated and disgusting but they won’t have none of it. THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT.

There has been times of laughter but it’s short lived and doesn’t really make up for anything. I hardly remember those times."
"My oldest is going to be in first grade soon, and it is very likely he will be riding the school bus and be responsible for going up to the apartment BEFORE anyone else in the family does.

I don't really want him to have a phone yet. I've heard of smart watches for children that can help in case of emergencies: GPS tracking, 2-way voice communication (only with selected numbers), etc.

Anyone can recommend a product? Preferably not one that's locked in with a carrier or a geographical location, so that the answer can help anyone (I am in Israel, if it matters).

Thanks!"
"My 9 month old is a happy healthy boy and a joy during the day but he always wakes up screaming and crying from every nap after about a half hour.  At night probably 6 out of 7 days of the week, he will wake up screaming and crying about a half hour after laying him down (bedtime is 7:30, we have a running joke of if he will make it to 8 before waking up), but will go back to sleep again after some soothing

At between 2 and 4am every night, he wakes up screaming bloody murder and has done so for months.  He will refuse to go back to sleep unless brought into bed with us.  He will calm down when picked up and held and even fall asleep in our arms but the second he is laid back down in his crib he starts his screaming and crying again.  We did an experiment when we didn't need to be up early for work and just see if he would eventually tire himself out.  Nope.  He screamed for four hours straight.  We bought our downstairs neighbors a bottle of wine just in case it was loud enough to disturb them.  Once he was up for his regular daily routine he was fine again, happy and behaving normally.

I realize this is probably just regular baby stuff but we need to get some sleep and the only way we can do that is to bring him into bed which is a terrible habit.  Any advice here?  Thanks"
"Hey there, 

My wife and I have a seven-year-old boy, he is healthy, happy, and empathetic.   

I am writing today because my belief in life is that there is always room for improvement, in this case, I want to learn how to address specific parenting issues, and also recap interactions between me and my son to gain constructive criticism.  

Is this the right place to be?  If so, how do I provide background information such as homelife, medical issues, etc? I would much rather use an online forum than wait for an appointment with a childcare counsellor."
"My mother in law babysits my 13 month old while my husband and I both work full time. She's a wonderful grandmother but she's pretty old school when is comes to raising babies. She has 3 kids, So I don't want to come off like I know more than her, also I'm really passive and don't like confrontation. 
The current issue is bottles and  nap time. I'd like to wean off the bottle as I stopped breastfeeding a week ago. At home after work, dd gets dinner and water and is sleep trained, she's not nursed or given a bottle to go to sleep.  
It seems like my MIL gives her bottles all day, including to put her down for a nap, she doesn't like to drink milk from a cup and MIL doesn't like to see her upset. I have guilt about not being there to transition dd to drink from a cup and putting this stress on my MIL. I also work in pediatric nutrition specifically with obesity so I over worry about her nutrition , And getting too much milk."
"Hello there.

I'd like to know if it is normal to put limits on her Internet time?She does the school at home now, with the lock down etc.

As i don't want to create a monster, i'd like to know if it is okay to put limits. Do you put limits like these?

She's 14 years old. When she has free Internet, she has no regulation over the time she passes on it.

Any idea? :)

I feel like a monster when i do put her a limit of 1 hour during lunchtime... crazy, isn't it?

Thank you.

PS : english is not my native language ;)"
My wife and I have chosen to sleep in the same bed as our 7 yr old. He takes turns sleeping in master bed or in his bedroom with mom. We choose this because we both get up at very different times and I am a light sleeper. I usually build a wall of pillows and bedding to keep him from touching me with his feet. It works sometimes but not all the time. Is there a way to create a barrier that will keep little toes from exploring?
"I have a 16 month old and another on the way (due November). This far, we have gotten away with having no form of toy storage, but we are just getting by. The playroom is a disaster and our living room just has random piles of toddler toys everywhere. I’d like to get a bit more organized, but I don’t want to just go out and buy the first organizer I see without thinking through the logistics.

How do you organize toys? What do you like about your system? What do you dislike or what would you have done differently? Did you have to change up your organizing as they got older? If so, how?"
"My son 14 asked me to wake him up early so that I could help him with an English assignment, but when I tried to wake him up he was very angry, yelled, and even kicked me.  I’m not sure what to do.  I’ve never been physical with my kids as a form of punishment and he has already lost all of his electronics for a previous infraction.  He’s still in bed now and I am going to attempt to wake him up again soon.  Any ideas on effective ways to wake up teenagers? Thanks"
"My 3yo has always been like this but its getting worse with no kindergarten.

She cries about everything. And i mean everything really. But its no ordinary crying, its ""im gonna scream my heart out until i have what i want even if i pass out"" kind of crying. Its horrible to see your Child not calming down and losing her breath because of some french fries.

She'll ask for something like cereal, i say no and she Just loses her temper.
She asks for something else, I say yes and she'll start screaming.
She asks for another thing, I say wait, she starts screaming again.

Is this normal? God I'm stuck in the house with her for 2 months and I'm going insane with so much screaming. I don't know what to do"

"My 5 month LO is starting to confuse me big time. He’s never been a particularly calm baby - he was born very alert, is always observant and expressive and tbh quite a demanding baby.

Over the last couple of weeks I’ve noticed some very distinct good and bad days with him. I can literally fell from the second we wake up. 

A good day begins with him smiling at me as soon as he opens his eyes, is generally a happy day with minimal fussing other than the usual hunger/tired/bored/unwell and I can get some stuff done (albeit not much) without him kicking up a fuss.

A bad day, he won’t smile when he wakes up. He’ll spend the majority of the day screaming, crying, fussy and angry. I have to pick him up constantly and even that doesn’t calm him sometimes. The only quiet I get is when he’s feeding or asleep. I find myself getting really overwhelmed on these days and sometimes have to just leave him to cry (safely where I can see him obviously) for a little while just to recompose myself. 

It doesn’t seem to have any correlation with leaps according to WW, and it doesn’t seem to make much difference where we are or what we’re doing.

Has anyone else experienced this? I know everyone has good and bad days but his bad days are just so intense. Does it pass? Is it indicative of his future personality?"
" Hello all! I need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

How/when did you breastfeeding mamas choose to stop pumping?

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: My little man turned 8 months old Monday (May the fourth haha) and he has been breastfed since birth. When I went back to work in November he was 2.5 months old and EBF. Eventually, though, we had to start supplementing with formula because I was not able to pump more than what he was eating at the sitters (I did have a freezer stash that dwindled fast). At that time it was only 1 formula bottle while I was at work and he got boobie ""from the tap"" all other feedings. In the last month or two he started getting frustrated while breastfeeding, even after eating off both sides, and crying in hunger afterwards as well. More recently he has started getting so worked up and crying when I try that he won't even look at my boob. He will only nurse in the morning right after waking up, otherwise he refuses to latch. My pumping sessions at work have been on the same schedule since I came back (pumping an average of 8oz per day in November), but I'm now only getting about 0.5oz total for the day. We have since started solids, so I know that contributes to a drop in production. I have also gotten new parts for my pump, so I know the suction is good as well. I also bought a manual pump to keep at home and when he started sleeping through the night I would pump before bed (and last night I got not even half an ounce).

&amp;#x200B;

So, my dilemma is the fact that I have to pull someone from another office to cover my desk twice a day so I can pump 25+ minutes each session. Is it still worth it when I only get 0.5 ounces?"
"Last night I was playing peek a boo with LO (6months). She was belly laughing and we were having so much fun. On the last one I scared the absolute crap out of her. Like she legit screamed out in fear, you could see it in her eyes. The whole deal. She started crying and her dad came to comfort her after I couldn’t. She would not look at me, I went to lay next to her to read books and she flinched when I came near her! My heart is completely broken. This morning she was happy to see me but every once in a while she will look at me like she doesn’t trust me. I can tell she doesn’t feel safe with me right now. Anyone else have this happened to them and can tell me my child won’t hate me for forever?"
"i find that most apps have 3-4 free subgames and the rest of the 10 subgames are restricted to paid customers. There are so many apps that does this. I don't want to purchase two different apps that basically teaches the kid the same principal thing... so do you suggest i stick with one developer and their apps?

or is there a popular app out there (free or paid) that i haven't heard off that is highly recommended by the community?

thanks in advance for your suggestions and advises."
"My 4yo is a VERY picky eater. I don’t know when that happened,  because up until he was 2 or so he would just eat whatever I gave him. Now it’s basically limited to the same 5 things. The only veggie/fruit he eats are apples. He ate a bunch of fruit for a while but that stopped too. The only way I get fruit/veggies into him is through pouches. My husband and I enjoy fruit and veggies and he sees us eat them during family dinner time, so it’s not like we’re just bad role models.
What bothers me the most is that he absolutely refuses to try anything. And that’s not limited to healthy foods, even if it’s a snack/cookie/sweets he doesn’t know he won’t try it. 
The only advice I’ve gotten so far is „If he doesn’t want to try it he’ll just have to go hungry. If he’s hungry enough he’ll try it.“ but I feel like that’s the wrong way to go and could possibly establish a bad relationship with food. 
Does anyone have any advice on how to get him to try more things and eat more fruit/veggies?"
"My son loves bedtime stories. Wants them all the the time. Sometimes a get bored with and/or can’t remember All the “normal” bedtime stories.  So awhile now I’ve resorted to telling him movies I’ve seen as stories. Reworking them sometimes so they are simpler and age appropriate.  
Tonight I just told him a bedtime story about a Pet detective named Ace Ventura....he loved it."
"I need help/advice. I am having a bad mental health day. But we have a list of stuff to do from my 7yo school for the day.
Some of the things he definitely needs my help for like baking, but the thought of doing it with him and the 2yo, who have just been screaming at each other this morning and playing up, fills me with dread. 

Any ideas how to fix this, I can feel my stress and anxiety rubbing off onto them, causing their behaviour to be worse. But I never know how to stop it."
"My sister in law is in the final stages of her life on earth and after talking to the girls (9,10) they have decided that they want to be with me. It will be a temporary guardianship and may be changing if they decide to go with their aunt or cousin. We (their aunt, cousin, and I) are creating a little network of parental support for the girls and are open to wherever they decide to me. I am 25 and haven’t raised kids yet but love and know these kids very well. And have been a part of their lives for many years. I feel prepared emotionally and mentally. I’m freaked out financially. Before today, my parents were paying my phone bill and I had split my car insurance bill 50/50. That’s going to be on me now (along with all my other finances). I lost my job in COVID. But have been looking for a new one and am in the interviews stage of a few places. I’m in school and will have my masters by the end of next year. Anyway I just needed to put this out there. I just got off the phone with my dad and both of my parents are pretty freaked out and disappointed in my decision to do this and that fear and anxiety is leaking onto me. I am scared. If there is anyone who could be a contact for me to talk through anything or get advice from I think that would be really helpful. Obviously this is only a fraction of the story and I’m not interested in hearing “you have no idea what you’re in for” or “have you thought about how you’re going to take care of xyz”"
"I’ve been pushing off getting LO (11 mo) a push walker because he’s been so close to walking and I didn’t want to get it and then him start walking the next day. So I finally found a toddler stroller, which he can push to walk around but he can use it when he gets a little older to play pretend, and there’s a little doll too that he has. And after about a week of waiting for it to come it came today. And I gave it to him and he was having such a blast, walking around. Literally has been pushing it from the time he woke up from his nap. So he walks into the living room with it, stopping about 3 feet short of the coffee table. And wouldn’t ya know it, he fucking lets go of the damn thing and takes his first steps unassisted, walking himself to the coffee table !!

All joking aside, I’m so excited! He did it one then and once after bath time. I’m so excited for him! He is literally wearing himself out trying so hard to walk haha. Yay!!"
"This is definitely not the first episode. She acts out frequently, and has even been admitted to a mental hospital for hurting a sibling in a fit of rage. But today's episode was particularly ill timed on my 14th anniversary and her younger sister's 9th B-day.

She was playing with play-dough and accidentally mixed two colors. This caused her to completely lose her mind. You would have thought someone just burned her favorite toy. You see, this is very common with her; her reaction to everyday displeasures is often very disproportionate, and has complete uncontrollable meltdowns to the most menial things. Today's incident was no different. We sent her to her room to cool off and she began to scream as loudly as she could. Her mother asked for her phone; there is a strict rule that she cannot have it when her temper is out of control. Taking her phone just made her more inconsolable.

Every 5 minutes she popper her head out her door saying ""I've calmed down"" but was still sobbing and being emotional. We kept telling her she needed to go back in and wait till we said it was time to come out. This would start her screaming uncontrollably all over again.

We ultimately let her out when she appeared calm, and her mother and I pulled her aside privately to discuss her behavior. As soon as we started talking about her issues, she could not tolerate hearing the least amount of criticism and went straight back to an all out tantrum, and we no longer could have any sort of conversation with her. She was sent back to her room. We had a birthday cake for her sister and we knew it would be unfair if she didn't have some, so we cut the cake with the family while our emotional 10 year old remained in her room. It made my wife and I feel horribly guilty but we could not bring her older sister down to join us in her condition.

Are we terrible parents? Are we scarring our 10 year old for life? Is her behavior normal? Should we be concerned? How should we deal with her behavior at this point, especially knowing that she refuses to take any personal responsibility for her own actions."
My daughter is 3 almost 4 years old and shes mostly potty trained which is great. However. She has pooped in almost 5 days and I keep telling her to go but she'll sit on toilet for 10 seconds and then tell me she doesnt have to poop. And I'm freaking out. Her last poop was pretty hard and she had a hard time and I imagine it hurt. She seems fine otherwise but I dont know what to do. And I think the clinics are closed? But taking her to emerge seems like an over reaction.
"Clearly not tiring of talking to people online, my kids are currently having a zoom conference with each other. From their bedrooms, which are separated by a wall. I can hear both sides of the conversation."
"My SIL told my husband that my kids nap too much. According to this 22 year old expert, it’s “not normal” for my one year old to need a morning AND an afternoon nap. 🙄"
"Even during these difficult and scary times, I have learned that my MIL believes it is important to first suck on the pacifer (""to lube it up"") before handing it to the baby. This is not her first grandchild, and she is a teacher. However, this is my first child and somehow that negates my opinion because I am just an ""overprotective first time mom"". (I love it when people say that like my two miscarriages don't matter...)

Looking for help. Articles. References. Anything I can send to her and my spouse as proof besides ""you are  effing nasty!!"""
"When my daughter was tiny I had plans to get her into all sorts of classes asap: ballet, king fu, music, swimming, pottery, you name it. She's 6 now and has a 3 year old brother and they're enrolled in none of these things. They're both on the waiting list for swimming lessons but that's it. I can't really budget for much more than that so I guess I've paired it down to bare essentials.

I'm from an academic family (me, my 2 brothers and my parents collectively hold 11 good degrees from top universities, mostly in maths &amp; physics but with some humanities thrown in) but we're basically rubbish at everything else. I've been trying to learn the keyboard for 2 years and can only do one song well. I've tried to teach my daughter the scales and 'doe re me' and stuff but she's not at all interested.

Both kids are fantastic at maths and seem to really enjoy it. Should I just go with that and ignore all the other stuff I can't afford &amp; don't know how to teach? Or is branching out more important?"
So caught my son in a lie🤦🏾‍♂️ but I couldn’t help but be impressed 🤔 I heard the children fighting in the living room... they both have the same color tablet and Ben is screaming Mine so I pull a King🤴Solomon and say no more tablet. Ben says Alex can have it🥰.... but Alex starts acting funny🤔 so I look at the tablet it profile says Alexander.... so I pick up the other tablet “Bens” the battery is dead 💀 but when it powers back up Behold Alexander’s profile 🤔 🤦🏾‍♂️ Alexander found out you can switch profiles on the Tablet.... So when his tablet dies or can’t connect to the internet he takes Bens tablet and switches the Profile. 🤦🏾‍♂️ he’s 3.
"My wife and I had our first kid recently. He's about 2.5 months old now. It feels like he has all the problems possible without having serious medical problems.

He still has trouble breastfeeding. We've tried everything the LCs told us, everything the doctors have told us, and everything we've read online. Nothing has really worked. Now the position he accepts is lying down. He still struggles, squirms, pulls back, etc all the time. He never really pops off himself, we always have to manually pop him off after 30 minutes. He eats every 2 hours during the day without exception. Everyone told us he would start feeding for less time and less frequently but it hasn't happened. Every two hours my wife has to go struggle with him to eat.

He has pretty bad acid reflux. He is still gaining weight which is great, but he vomits constantly. I don't mean spit up. I mean vomit, thick yellow curdled milk stinky vomit. All day long. We hold him upright 30 minutes after eating. He pukes several times. Afterwards, he will continue to throw up until it's time to eat again, which feels like no time at all because it takes him 30 minutes to eat, 30 minutes to stay upright, and that only leaves 1 hour remaining until he's screaming for more food again. We've removed all the top 8 allergens from our diet. That got rid of the blood in his poop, but it's done nothing for his reflux. We got a rocker that is supposed to hold him upright, but he hasn't taken to it after several weeks and he still just throws up in it all the time. I started tracking the vomit the last few days and his number of vomits were 16, 19, 21, and 18. We are at our wits end with the reflux, but the doctor just keeps saying it's fine as long as he gains weight.  Our medicine to help with reflux pain got recalled and the new medicine doesn't work as well so now he's in pain after vomiting all the time.

And gas. He has gas pains all the time. Bicycle kicking does next to nothing. The thing where you straighten their legs and them push up doesn't do much either. Sometimes he is inconsolable for 20ish minutes, usually followed by a poop. 

When is it suppose to get easier? Everyone keeps saying it's supposed to get easier. When?? It feels like it's only gotten worse. I'm very grateful he doesn't seem to have serious medical problems as of now, but it's hard to make it through the day sometimes in his current state."
"Sorry, there's probably a more succinct way of stating this... and maybe it even exists: 

There should be some software (or settings on PC) I could use to give our kids feedback on their own voice volume when wearing headphones... Sometimes we let them play games in the early evening so we can get some quiet time. But when the kids have their headphones on, their voice volume goes to almost yelling level. There’s no feedback loop for them, and they have no idea how loud they’re talking. Even if you try to warn/condition them, after about 5 minutes they completely forget and occasionally shout out something excitedly. Today my wife wanted to take a nap but kept getting woken up. What I really want is software that causes a beep or very loud feedback back into the headphones when the mic volume goes up past a certain decibel level. Just so there’s some classical conditioning feedback loop and they can learn to speak at low (or at least normal volumes), not like some excited Youtuber.

In certain games you can set the game and chat volumes differently, but you’re still not getting your own voice level feedback. And the problem exists even for watching a video. We've asked them to wear the headphones with one ear off, but they'll still talk to their sibling sitting right next to them like they're across the house.

I can't be the only one with this issue!"
"I have two girls (5 &amp; 8). My 5 yr old can't entertain herself at all. We are on week 8 with no school, no friends, no park...no anything. She might actually be entering a type of psychosis. She spends the day saying ""I'm bored"" or ""I'm hungry"". If she's not saying those words, she's  throwing herself on the floor, crying, kicking her feet, having a true meltdown tantrum. She has noticeably regressed in maturity. Her sister will try to play with her but she just gets angry and screams in her face and physically assaults her. I've actually sent my 8 yr old away for her protection, at this point. 

Background: Both my children are adopted from state foster care. I got each one at 3 days old. My older one was extremely drug exposed. She has severe ADHD, mild atypical autism, and pretty bad learning disabilities bc she's dyslexic. She's doing pretty good with the whole stay home thing bc she hates school. My younger one was drug exposed but we don't know how much. She's hearing impaired and wears hearing aids but is not deaf. It's a mild to moderate hearing loss. 
I am raising them alone, basically, as my ex, their adopted father, was arrested and pled guilty three and a half years ago to possession of child porn. He has monitored visitation with them, but they didn't see him for a year first. During that time, I met a guy. I got serious with him and we all moved in together, including his teenage daughter. He died of cancer 6 months ago...

SO we've had some tragedy. My older daughter has been in counseling and under psychiatric care the whole time but due to our low economic status, I couldn't get my younger one in until she was 5. She had just started counseling when the pandemic hit and now they've had no counseling for 2 months either. I'm so tired."
"I'm expecting my first child this June. I wake up every day at 3:30 am for work at the sound of alarm clocks. My wife is very concerned about the baby's sleep, and waking her from my alarm clocks. 

What are some solutions to this dilemma? I can't not go to work, and my wife is suggesting i sleep in the living room.

Any advice would be appreciated."
"Basically ever since this COVID-19 pandamic I couldn’t stop thinking about this. Who will look after them? Where will they go? Will they be looked after properly?
This really prompted me to bite the bullet and finally have a conversation with my sister.
We agreed that if something happens to one of us, the other will look after their kids, and then i created one of those [apparently someone thought this was advertising so removed the name] app accounts to upload instructions, birth certificates, doctor information etc. to automatically send if I’ve passed away.

I was wondering if there’s anything else I should do? What have you guys organised?
I’m also looking into life insurance too (as I’m main income provider)

EDIT: Summary of Tips so far

1. Life Insurance - Have it 🙌🏼
2. Speak to people before handing over guardianship.
3. Pick people that understand your parenting style and are in good health. If possible, have backups just in case too.
4. Leave important documents and information (birth certificates, passports, video messages) in a fireproof safe or use something like aforementioned app
5. Most importantly - make a will that is legally binding."
"Just broke down and ugly cried in the hallway. Here's why.

Our almost 3yo loves going in the bathroom when mom is going. So, I was trying to pick up 3yo and take her in another room, when she just goes limp on me and starts angry screaming in my face. The kind where it's ""first gear"" screaming, then shifts into a higher, angrier ""second gear"" screaming. 

This has been happening a lot lately, and it's quite upsetting to both me and mom. So I don't get angry myself or do something stupid, I put 3yo in her room and just shut the door. She continued to scream for about a minute. Then a minute later she opens the door and comes over to me and hugs me (we've taught her hugs are sorry since she can't say it yet.)

Mom eventually took 3yo a couple minutes later to go play outside, and I just broke down and cried. I love my daughter so much, but this shit is hard."
"During his naps he sleeps in his crib, but at night he can not sleep alone. If he his dead asleep and I move him over, without fail, in 5 minutes or less he will wake up and begin crying. It’s honestly starting to strain the intimate aspect of my relationship. He hates being swaddled and can’t be comforted so the only solution I can resort to is having him sleep in our bed. If anyone can give me any advice, I’d truly and deeply appreciate it."
"Long story short, my dad is about to enter palliative care for advanced cancer, and is stopping treatment. We do not know how close to the end he is, but likely not long.

I have a 5 year old son. We live 1800 miles away across a closed border, so we will not be able to be there when he passes, attend a funeral, etc. Recently they have been doing occasional facetime chats, but that has stopped as my dad's health deteriorated rapidly. We were supposed to visit them a month ago (which my son was really looking forward to), but COVID stopped that.

He knows that Grandpa is sick, and has been in the hospital a few times recently. He is also very aware of COVID, and knows that we are staying home to stop the spread of the disease because it can make people very sick.

Besides the fact that I am trying to process my own grief that my parents are going to have to go through this alone, as will my siblings (none of us can get to them or each other), I have to figure out what to tell my kid.

Should I tell him in that Grandpa has become sicker, and is going to die?

Should I tell him nothing in advance, and tell him after it happens that Grandpa's body was too sick and he died?

My big concern is that I do not want to traumatize him, and I don't want him thinking that Grandpa died of COVID, or that it might kill him too. He will obviously see his dad and I grieving and being sad, which is healthy but will likely be scary for him; and the death will be very removed for him.

I'm kind of trying to bury my own helpless grief in pragmatic planning and overthinking."
"Based off google reviews I've tentatively scheduled an install of a Baby Barrier pool fence for this coming weekend.  I did a little research and found several DIY kits online with decent reviews, however I'm already pretty overwhelmed at the moment and don't really want another project but as my son is on the verge of walking I don't want to drag my feet any longer and prefer to have a professional do put this in for me.  I've seen lots of positive reviews for Baby Barrier as a company but I haven't seen much in regards to rating the quality of the product they provide so I'm hoping someone has perspective while I still have time to cancel the appointment.  The fence includes a 10 yr pro-rated warranty but I see a lot of the DIY kits have lifetime warranties so that's a little bit of a red flag to me."
"I wanted to get some advice since my husband and I have the same fights over and over again.

I think its okay to let my three children (5,3,1) to watch a bit of tv (2hrs/day).

He thinks we should shut it down completely. Like throw the tv out. 

I think them watching some educational material, fun cartoons and such isn’t going to harm them, if they have other activities throughout the day."
"Ok, so my two year old daughter has recently starting bumping herself into things (Mostly bumping her knee onto the floor) and then asking for a ""Bandaid"" afterward. I've told her plenty of times that she needs to stop and if she does it on purpose she won't get one, but no matter how many times I do she won't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this kind of behavior normal? I'm getting worried because she is doing it hard enough to make her knees red and and I'm scared one of these days she is going to actually hurt herself."
"I’m a single parent and my mom, sister, and brother are extremely helpful.

I appreciate and am grateful, however when I set boundaries they don’t like that.

Whenever we are having disagreements(in which we aren’t talking about my daughter)  and they feel I should just should agree with their point of view they say this in some variation “I hope your daughter doesn’t become like you.”  

 I am not perfect but, I think we can agree that when people say that they are trying to state you don’t want your child to have all your negative traits, yet even tho they recognize that they continue to do so.

I think it’s reasonable to set a boundary so they don’t keep weaponizing my daughter and how she will be against me.

Am I wrong in thinking that there are others ways they can communicate the traits they wish I could let go, instead of using my parenthood as a way to jolt me to my senses?"
"I have been blessed to be a SAHM for the past 5 months with our 15 month old and we just had #2 who is now 1 week old. I quit pumping after 5 weeks with #1 because of the time constraint after going back to work and formula was just easier and sleep was nice.

Baby #2 is a natural and my supply has been great but I don't want to pump because I need as much time with #1 as I can get. My mom, her main caregiver, is retired and can help anytime. The doctor, a very blunt Russian woman, said that I have ""other priorities"" (exclusively BF) and that #1 will be ok with spending more time with my mom. 

My mom can just come to my house to help or I can go over there but #1 gets jealous and has been pretty needy this past week and demands my attention when the baby needs to eat. Now I'm thinking just going to formula will be better for my relationship with #1 even though BF is going great. I've been fighting back tears since this morning. Doc also said it's beneficial for me because ""diabetes and cancer prevention"" and this is our last baby. I don't care about me, I'll gladly take diabetes and cancer to be with #1 as much as possible. What do I do?"
"I need some advice about how to let her know that she doesn’t need to be afraid of the fire alarm ringing. It started yesterday when the fire alarms went off... since then she will say out loud that she’s scared and covering her eyes. She won’t look up and isn’t her cheery self. Any ideas of how to let her know that she shouldn’t be afraid.

I’ve tried to talk to her about it, tried to get the alarm off and letting her see/touch that it’s not scary, watching videos about it- nothing I do seems to be working.


Update: We got “rid” of the fire alarms and now everytime she looks up at the ceiling they’re “gone” but she keeps repeating that she’s scared casually every once in a while. It seems to working and hopefully, “out of sight, out of mind.” Thanks for the replies.... just going to say this a temporary solution."
"Dad of two teens checking in. 

I wonder if someone wouldn't mind leaving a comment with something nice? I'm just completely empty. This is so hard. I know it will be ok, but right now, being a parent feels pretty awful. I feel like I have no one I can talk to. Thanks for any kind words."
"What did you do to get through the newborn sleep phase? 

We just brought our little one home  from the hospital and she refuses to lay on her back. She sounds gassy and mucousy 3-5 minutes after putting her down, then she's awake crying again. 
With all the ""safe sleep"" regulations it seems like theres nothing we can do but stay awake holding her all night, but then I'm so exhausted falling asleep while holding her in unsafe positions, like standing up. This is our second, so we know it's a phase that will pass (with the first we managed mostly by taking shifts), but curious how others have gotten through it and hopfully find some tips or helpful ideas!"
"My oldest son (he will be 3 y/o in 2 weeks) is 3 ft 7’ inches, imagine having the size of a 4 yo in the mind of a 2 yo. Add to this he has a speech delay (his muscles are not strong enough for him to talk properly, he talks but we barely understand). Anyhow, I’m fucking tired of people assuming he has to be TEA. (We got him tested, he’s not). But people see this huge boy who doesn’t talk right and immediately think there is something wrong with him. Why people can’t see he’s the most loving boy ever, the fact that he has manners like saying hello to everyone he crosses by ? I’m so tired of people, some have even told me I must have him on GRowth hormones because it’s not normal for him to be this big and I’m so pissed. HES JUST BIG. I’m sorry I’m done. Thank u"
"I don’t know how people do stay home parenting. I just started back to work yesterday and my daughter is just acting insane. And I know it’s because her schedule is changing again but there’s other factors im just having trouble managing right now and it’s taking it all out of me. I’m currently sitting here with a blanket all the way over my head while she literally yells her “repeat this” words back at her computer because we have to do homework in the evening now. I know she’s frustrated with school work but I don’t even care if she finishes it anymore.
She has something called PKU, which calls for a strict low protein diet. And she’s always hungry like take a regular 5 year old snacky hungry and add to it. I’m always cooking special meals for her. I’m tired. I have type 1 diabetes and I just can’t even find the time to take care of myself, which I guess is fine considering type 1 never goes away so whatever. 
We’re also moving in 3 weeks out of a 3 bed 3 bath massive house into a small apartment and I’m losing my mind. 
She’s on medicine to help her be allowed to eat more protein in a day, but it makes her hyperactive. And I can’t get a doctor to diagnose her with add even though both her teacher and myself see it. They all just say “she’s being 5”. But it’s so much more than just being 5. She literally says her head feels all jumbled and she can’t follow her thoughts there too many. 

Idk. I just needed to rant. I’m so tired mentally and physically. And I’m just breaking down. And it was like this before the stay home orders it’s just gotten worse now. It’s that point where I just want some of my previous life back. A breather. Just a single minute to sit down without a kid stealing my blanket or shoving their elbow on me as they try to climb on top of me. I don’t want to read anymore freaking bedtime stories right now. 

How do you guys cope?"
"I have 2 daughters, a neurotypical 6 y/o and my 4 y/o who was recently diagnosed with autism. We have been going through the process of getting her therapies in place, doing our best to advocate for her, and trying to teach her with the current distant learning restrictions in place. Going through this process has educated us on how wonderful, fun and joyous these kids with special needs are but also shone a light on the absolute intense WORK it takes to care and raise a child with special needs. We are fortunate in that she is physically independent and able to complete many tasks without help, I have so much respect for the parents and guardians of kids who are much more impacted by their condition. It is very much like having a full time job; she currently has 6 hours/week of speech therapy and then 20 hours of additional supporting therapies. On top of that she needs around the clock care and has a tendency to wander in the night, so she has eyes on her 24/7. 

Neurotypical children are also a ton of work, I don’t want to diminish that. But, I never realized how much love, patience, and time having a special needs child requires. And I’m so thankful for all of it, they are so so worth it."
"My husband and I have been looking to buy an apartment and finally found something we love in our price range. It's newly renovated and has a private terrace (luxury in NYC area), however it's on a 4th floor walk-up. We're planning on having a baby soon and I did not see anywhere to store a stroller downstairs. We're both young and somewhat athletic but still.. I have never tried to walk down/up a stairs holding a baby, stroller, diper bag, normal bag..  is this doable?! My husband thinks it's ok but I'm slightly freaked out. What do you guys think?"
"Hi all,

We are getting going on having a sibling for my 22 month old daughter. Obviously that means I’m getting a little bit nervous about what that will mean for our family. We have a really great routine and comfortable situation with my daughter now, and I know that adding a new baby could potentially be dropping a bomb on all of that. Many people have tried to scare me by saying that having number 2 was WAY harder than number 1 for them, but I’m skeptical because my first was an extremely challenging experience for me. Not only was she colicky and sensitive and screamed every single day for hours during those first few months, we were also moving into a new house at the time so it was overall chaos. I’m really hoping that this time around is easier. 

Can anyone throw me a bone and tell me some positive stories about baby #2?"
"I just had my first baby three weeks ago. I have three weeks left on my parental leave before I go back to work. I’m so unbelievably nervous and anxious to leave him for so long. I work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week and have an hour commute each way so at minimum I’m gone for 12 hours (usually more) every day that I work. 

I have this irrational fear that he won’t even recognize me since I’ll be gone so long. Any advice for coping with this? Will I adjust once I start back at work for a few days? Thanks in advance!"
"Daughter(15F) has been staying up later and later into the night until 4 or 5 in the morning, before sleeping in until 2 or 3 in the afternoon. How do I get her to fix her sleep cycle?"
"My son has been crawling for a while now but this past week he's decided he wants to test out the dry dog food and the first time you could see he disliked it so much he couldn't unscrew his face but a few days later he went back again and it hasn't stopped.

No matter how many times I say no and take him away from the food he'll be really quiet and I'll find him nibbling on some dog food with the crumbs all over his face. 

As I only catch him in the act I never see the start of it I don't know if he's leaning down like a dog or picking it up with his hands but today he was over the bowl on all fours chewing away.

I get everyone will say take the food off the floor but we have 6 little dogs and we leave the dry food down for them to have through the day, and also the food is in a very heavy marble bowl. 

Is there any way for me to teach my son that this isn't what he should be doing and that eating dog food is kind of nasty?"
"New dad here. Baby is 1 year and 2 months old. 

I haven’t been on a date with my wife 1 on 1 since my daughter was born. And of course can’t go out now amid to the lock down. 

But I wanted to know the importance of dating 1 on 1 with your significant other after the baby? 

I just do chores with my wife. Go store, buy food, etc. 

My wife is a great mother. I help with as much as I can. But slowly, I’m seeing my wife as just a mom/boss. 

I still see my wife as attractive, but it’s not like I’m attractive, attractive to her. I just see her as a great mom/ partner. 

We don’t get all lovey dovey anymore. Yes, small kisses once in a while. Dry spell in the bedroom since baby sleeps in the room. ( live with sister and brother so no extra room for baby) 

Yeah been feeling as if she is just a partner. 

Anyone been in this phase and how did you guys go about being attractive toward your partner again?"
"Ugh I feel like shit. Today I was on a work conference call and my 1 year old was pulling at some plugged in cords. I walked over with my laptop in one hand and with the other I got her hand and picked her up. It wasn't violent or jerky but when I put her down she started screaming. It was quickly evident something was very wrong because she would not use the arm.

I knew I did it. I just held her and sobbed. It was just too much... lockdown, full time work, children at home, lack of sleep, and now I injured my baby. We ended up having to go to urgent care and they did a completely traumatic X ray on the poor kid. All because of me. 

It's most likely nursemaids elbow apparently. She will be ok and I will be ok. But we are not ok today.

Thanks for attending my pity party."
"Out LO is 15mo and running around. We wanted him to start walking outside and getting him used to wearing shoes so we researched some good shoes and came across Stride Rite which had soft leather, grippy soles, and lots of good reviews. We actually bought these before the quarantine so we had the option of going to a baby shoe store to get them fitted properly. He’s been wearing them more recently but now they’re giving him blisters on his angle right above his heel. Looking for recommendations of a new brand that’s maybe a little softer. Thanks!

Edit: yes we are definitely using socks! Thanks for all the great ideas"
"Title says it all.
I didn’t grow up speaking English so I am not exposed so much to litterature here . But I would like to read some inspiring books for my amazingly wise and deep 8 year old girl. 

Classics are most welcome but modern books too.

Thank you SO much.

PS: Books built me as a person. I grew up with an abusive mom. My refuge was books. Now ... I am not saying this is my daughter and I am aware to not project my own experience on her. But I do remember how deeply affected I was reading about other people going through their life experiences and how it helped me form my ideas about the world .
Thank you!"
My 7-year-old always wants to go to bed late because she's not tired. She was very active with sports when activities were open and still not tired. She always heads to bed at 9 pm and sometimes has a hard time falling asleep. What time does your 7-year-old go to bed and what is their/your routine to get them to bed?
"I’ve done nothing but praise my darling nine year old for the past week. His behaviour has been good and even sleeping in his own bed now.. that all changed tonight.

He decided to use my bed as a launch pad. Bounce, bounce, bounce.. bang. Bed is completely broken apart and can’t be put back together. Siiiigh! Literally lost my job with this covid stuff and now I’m broke as a joke sleeping with my mattress on the floor with a bad back and knees. 

I know accidents happen, we all make mistakes but why oh why don’t children listen after years of being told not to jump on the bed?! I don’t know whether to laugh or cry at just how horrible life feels right now. 😓"
"My husband and I are one of those blessed one who can work from home. But we have a 1 yr old and 7 yr old. And honestly after two months of lockdown I am loosing it. My 1 yr old wants to be held all the time and she is crying constantly for attention. The 7 yr old needs help with school stuff and is not good with playing by himself. He constantly ask for the tv, never wants to go out. I am barely getting anything done at work, I am exhausted all the time cause I feel like I am working all the time. I have lost appetite, having trouble sleeping and depressed in general. Yesterday I felt like I was getting sick from hearing my 1 yr old crying. And to make it worse my husband and I are not in good terms.
Any ideas, tips from fellow parents is greatly appreciated."
"The weather has turned yet again typical, resulting in us having to find things to do inside the house.

We’ve always had a lovely home growing up but when we moved into this house we had a lot of plans and ideas that didn’t happen soon enough or still haven’t happened. With time things change, pipes burst and flood through the kitchen ceiling and the list goes on.

With all this time we now have on our hands we’ve come together as a family and helped each other with the home improvements that the house has needed.

Due to Ro’s condition, we have to make sure the house is extra clean also because we do have dogs so this year we invested in a steam cleaner and oh my has it been a game-changer when it comes to cleaning.

The house has never been dirty we just have a lot of stuff so we’ve spent the week going through all the kitchen cupboards sorting, throwing, steaming and organizing each one.

The crazy thing about it is that the kitchen which has always been the heart of the house is now a happy place for all of us.  
Every night we have dinner together and most day breakfast and lunch too.

The boys have worked really hard and done an amazing job outside cleaning and drive and garden, Ro, of course, loves every second he can get outside to watch them.

With the house looking better it’s improving the way the family are feeling being inside and it’s feeling a little more like a home instead of just the house we live in.

Not being able to leave the house for walks with Ro is a little frustrating because I truly believe it helped me mentally, I didn’t have a build-up of emotions when we would walk it was a stress relief for me as well as exercise.

I’m not going to pretend that now I’m not walking I’ve started to work out at home because that would be a lie but what I have started to do is change my relationship with food. No more snack or big portions, Not eating just because it’s lunchtime when I’m not even hungry and I’ve started to feel so much better with myself and slowly I’m starting to see a difference in my body.

I would love to post a picture but I want to see some real changes before I do any of that plus, I still have some of the mum tum to get rid of.

My natural skin and hair journey still continues and I’m also starting to see a change in that too and it’s making me feel so much better every day. If I do put on some makeup it’s only my eyes and brows that I’ll do to still allow me skin to breathe.

With the lockdown, I’ve made the changes I should have made a long time ago because now there are no excuses and I refuse to be lazy and not try.

Ro goes to bed at the same time every day with no problems and has started to wake up less. He is eating nearly all of his food without most of it going on the floor, he now crawls normally but still thinks he can get up and walks so there’s a bump here and there but he’s all good.

He’s my first child and everyone thinks their child is amazing but, I really do think I got lucky because as much as he can drive me up the wall sometimes he’s a very good baby. I think because he’s not a problem when he does something it seems bigger than it is.

Every day is a blessing, even more so when you’re surrounded by people you love.

So guys, keep you’re chin up and keep smiling because life is what you make it and nothing good came from a frown."
"My husband and I are going with my parents to their vacation home at the end of the month, and we’re taking our daughter with us. By then, she’ll be almost seven months old. Originally, we were going to fly down, but with current circumstances, plans changed, and now we’re driving. We’re going down and coming back both in straight shots to avoid having to stay in hotels, but that makes it a 13-hour drive one way. A little over a month ago, we took her on a 4-hour round trip, and even for that we were all going crazy. We’re stoked about this vacation, but we’re absolutely DREADING the drive. My husband and I are first-timers - do any veteran parents (or even just parents more experienced than us) have any tips for traveling that far with a baby in the car?? Any advice or words of wisdom are appreciated! 😊"
"Hello! I’ve got a very active and cranky/clingy 1 year old. She’s scooting around and having a blast. She used to cruise holding onto furniture but now she only wants to hold onto me and it’s driving me absolutely batshit crazy. I sit on the floor and she is instantly on me, pulling on me and my hair. I try to redirect her by giving her the option to use her push cart, but she wants nothing to do with it. I try to move to sit on the couch but she just screams at me and whines until I get her and I have no clue what to do. Constantly being touched and clung onto like this has me feeling intense anxiety and I cannot handle it. She won’t try to sit down from standing unless she’s holding onto me. I don’t know how to fix this clinginess and give her the confidence to have independence...And I need a little space too (we’ve been at the house for two months straight as I’m a stay at home mom and do not want to risk my child’s health going out). We are both stir crazy. She’s very cranky and clingy, bored and I’m cranky and an anxious mess now. Any tips about how I can encourage her to have a little independence and feel comfortable exploring cruising on other things???"
"My two year old daughter will not wear her pants! Sometimes I can convince to wear some of they have a design that she likes, but it will only be a matter of time before she takes those off too. She will throw a fit and tear off her pants whenever I try to put them on. I feel like there is no winning unless I physically strapped them to her somehow. Is this normal behavior and does anybody have any tips on getting through this?

Thanks!"
"Please, please help. I'm a ftm with no one to turn to and I'm realizing I've done everything wrong up until now. Up until literally yesterday I was making the mistake of thinking every cry of his was a hunger cue. So I would feed him. Sometimes for hours. He used to fall asleep on the breast, but now he sucks and sucks with wide eyes. Over the past two weeks there havne't been many days where he has gotten a lot of sleep. One day he stayed up for 7 hours straiht. The next it was 12. And he's getting enough milk. He has plenty of diaper changes of both solid and liquid. I'm really losing my mind and am so sleep deprived. And we have started trying to rock him to sleep with white noise but he just cries inconsolibly. He has never liked rocking. I'm now reading that i only need to breastfeed for 15 minutes on each breast and htat's working. But how the hell do I get him to go to sleep? Please, please help."
"We're going ahead with a move this summer that we've been talking about for over a year. We'll be going to another state and hope to be settled by the fall so our son can start second grade at his new (hopefully permanent) school. In an ideal world, he would have completed first grade and had a chance to say goodbye to his friends, teachers, and school before we move. However, school closures due to coronavirus have thrown a huge wrench in those plans. How can we help to provide some closure for him when we'll likely be moving in the next couple of months (whenever it's safe to do so)? Some thoughts I had were scheduling some video chat goodbyes and/or planning a visit to the school next year whenever we come home to visit my family. Other ideas? TIA!"
"Don't get me wrong, I love my 3 year old (he is turning 4 in December) to death. When he's in a good mood, he's the best smart little boy ever.  He is a good brother to his younger sister who is 1 year old. He plays and shares with other kids his age. Daycare says hes a good lil boi. --

He's been very ""over - dramatic"" for quite some time. I don't know if this is normal or what. My son is the first baby I ever held/taken care of.  Please educate me. 

For example: When he finishes eating I help him wipe his hands and face with a baby wipe or whatever is available at that time. I barely touched him and then he screams bloody murder and saying owie!! you hurt me mommy!! and cries for 5 minutes straight. He has real tears flowing.. He acts the same way towards me or my spouse.

I'm scared someone might call the cops on me because his cry is so loud you can hear it outside. I don't want my neighbours to think I'm abusing him... because I am not! 

When it's time for bedtime, his sister is great at this. She crawls into her bed, drinks her bottle, sucks on her thumb and then sleeps. I don't really need to reassure her. She knows the routine. 

On the other hand, my son... I tell him it's bed time. He has a full melt down in his bed for 1 hour straight. He would kick and scream. Sometimes he will wake up his baby sister when she's passed out. Sometimes he will give up on crying and stay in his bed in silence. (we have baby lullabies playing in the background) or he will get out of bed and kick the door.

We have a consistent routine: dinner, bath time, bottles, sleep. --

My son wakes up at 730am in the morning and we have problems putting him down sometimes. We cut out nap time as well. He insists staying up until 11-12am! I know he needs more hours for sleeping. It's a constant battle when my spouse and I are both tired and he doesn't want to sleep. 

I feel like I'm doing a horrible job in regards to parenting :(  I always try to keep calm... but sometimes i feel like breaking down when he's crying that loudly."
"I'm bored. I have a minute to myself. I'm teaching my ten year olds time management by giving them chunks of time to get their school work done and setting up ""mom hours"" for them to come visit me with questions so that they aren't trying to play outside or watch their TV time and then we are doing school work at 6 PM. 

We had a regular schedule but after all this time-- this seems to be working the best. That made me think of skills. I'm now teaching them time management and prioritization. 

So for fun, what skills/life abilities do you want your children to have before they venture out into the real world at the grand age of 18/19/35 lol. How do you plan on teaching/showing them these skills ?"
"My baby is almost 3 months and it’s almost impossible to put her down even for a moment. I make sure she’s well fed, clean diaper, etc before trying but nothing seems to work. What started with just bedtime now has moved onto almost every moment now and I don’t want her to get Into the habit of sleeping with me and her to be okay having time by herself. Anyone have any advice?"
"My 3-year-old son seems to only be engaged with Y-7 shows that seem way beyond him...He's currently watching Gravity Falls and always begs for Scooby Doo and some really dumb Barbie show. He asks for scary ones and hasn't seemed to be negatively affected by them, but I don't want to give him any anxiety or fears. I was super sheltered as a kid and I'm having trouble navigating the right balance. 


How do you decide what's okay for your kids to watch? I just want him to watch Daniel Tiger and be happy!"
"My 15 month old daughter has basically slept through the night since she was about 7 weeks old. She's had a few bad night here and there, but never anything crazy. 

When she started sleeping in her crib around 4 months, I was still nursing so I'd nurse her to sleep. I stopped nursing her at 6 months due to supply issues, but my husband and I would still hold and rock her to sleep before putting her down. 

Now that she's older, we're trying to figure out the best way to get her to sleep on her own. She has a bedtime routine- bath, teeth brushing, books, and then we hold her until she's out. But we want to be able to do the first 3 and then put her in her crib, say goodnight, and leave the room and have her fall asleep on her own. If we try to do that right now, she'll be fine for a bit, maybe play around with something, and then start wailing for us to come back. She won't sleep unless we hold her. 

Does anyone have any advice? We never did sleep training or cio. I hate letting her cry in her crib for too long, I'm worried she'll have a negative association with it. She's our first so we're still in a constant state of learning and worrying we're doing things wrong. 

Do we just need to try the CIO method? Or is there something else we could try?"
"I have a 3 year old daughter who for the first two years of her life lived in another country where I wasn't able to be and had to miss out on some major life events. She also lived in a country where English isn't even the first language. Finally got her and her mom over here last year. Before the move I was so worried would I be a good dad? Would she know I'm her dad? Would she be able to transition well here in America? So many questions.

Well it's been a year now and in that time I got to be there for a birthday, her first Halloween, Christmas and Easter. She is also doing great she is speaking both Japanese and picking up English very fast. On top of all that the very first thing I get to hear when I come home is ""pick me up."" I'm super stoked to be a dad and see how she is developing into her own person."
"My 4 yr old daughter just called out my toxic mom for her behavior 

Daughter was riding her tricycle in the kitchen and turned into the fridge by mistake. My mom, who was in the other room, started yelling at her to get out of the fridge and keep the door closed. 

Daughter told her, “I wasn’t in the fridge!” My mom said “it sure sounded like you were. You better stay out.” Daughter said “I was NOT in the fridge. I was trying to turn around. That was rude of you to yell at me and you need to apologize.”

I, of course, was ready to back Daughter up, bc she wasn’t in the wrong, but my mom just said “I’m sorry for yelling at you.”

Had Daughter been snappy about it I would have redirected her but she was calm and matter of fact. I had a brief moment of “eh... should I let her?” But then I was like nah fuck that, she needs to know it’s ok to stick up for yourself regardless. 

So yeah. I was super proud of her."
"So my daughter is 17 months and has full on hit toddler stage like running into a brick wall... repeatedly... atm she is in time out for throwing. She usually gets a warning and then if she continues she gets time out. Right now time out is 2 minutes and she gets out and if she keeps up what she was doing to get in trouble she goes back for 5. She gets her comfort item in time out which is a blanket. 
I just feel like it is constant right now and so frustrating. She’s always in a good mood when she gets up with my husband of a morning (I can hear them, I never really go back to sleep but give them some daddy daughter time, but as soon as I get up it’s like you flip a switch. We have a good breakfast and she gets some tablet time and when that’s over it’s game over. The tablet goes up and she loses it. This is usually nap time but she even wakes up mad about it. I feel like we fight up and down all day. 
I try to keep her entertained doing other things and playing games but she’s so bored. We live in TN so we were going outside and playing in the warm weather. But it’s turned off cold or rainy for three days and we of course can’t have a day out because this lockdown. 
I’m tired, I feel bad that she is stuck inside, and I don’t want to just give her a tablet and give up. 
She’s used to being with my little brother every day. They run and play and have my dads whole house to play in while at home she just has her room and the living room. And I’m not as much fun as he is."
"My (34F) daughter (4) is turning 5 in late June. We live in North Carolina, USA, and phase one of reopening starts this coming weekend. We will continue to quarantine until we feel safe and don't plan on doing anything different for quite a while. Both parents are already essential workers with public contact, so we don't need to increase our risk. I just don't know what to do for her birthday. This was supposed to be her first big party with kids her age from preschool, but obviously a big group of kids in this climate is a horrible idea. Anyone have any ideas of what we could do for her? We would like to go visit her grandparents (who live on a lake with lots of activities to enjoy) who have been isolating the whole time since it's over a month from now. It could be safe for them to have contact with us but we just aren't sure. I would love any ideas on how to celebrate and make her feel special even without all of her school friends!"
"My daughter’s father was recently granted supervised visitation (heavy drinker) just before the pandemic hit the US. Since he was granted the visitation in January he has seen her once for less than 30 mins at the park in our neighborhood then wanted to head out. He was yawning the entire time and just didn’t really seem into it. 

I emailed him twice (our only form of communication) 5 days ago asking if he could help pick up some diapers and wipes for her since I’m not working at the moment. He was ordered to pay child support but doesn’t. Never has. So I figured maybe he’d be willing to help more during a time like this. He finally got around to responding and in his response asked if he and his mom can see her this weekend. 

The issue: my 1 year old daughter has asthma. She had a bronchoscopy performed last year to confirm. I’ve had to take her to the hospital for her breathing after catching the slightest cold before. It’s been pretty scary at times. Her age and asthma make her particularly high risk for the Coronavirus. My ex’s mom works in a hospital, which makes her a higher risk of being exposed to the virus. 

I understand that she probably misses her granddaughter who she hasn’t seen in about 8 months (I’m assuming because she has never contacted me to see her during this time). But isn’t it a bit selfish to want to possibly expose her to the virus so she can see her? My ex has been in and out of her life since she was born due to his routine disappearance to go binge drink for a a month at a time. He doesn’t understand the severity of her asthma because he’s never really been around for it so he acts like I’m just being mean and not wanting his family to see her. Which definitely isn’t the case. I truly wish I had a better relationship with them and could trust them with her, as I could really use the help and some me time. 

Any advice, experience, reassurance would be helpful as I don’t have many people to confide in when I need parenting/coparenting advice."
"I have a Step Daughter who is 4.5 and she won't keep her fingers out of her mouth. I know this is a thing that kids do (at least that is what people tell me) but with COVID-19 I'm worried more then ever. We have talked about germs and why we need to wash our hands.

I dont want to do anything to mess up her teeth. Holding something doesn't work because she sits it down and it gets lost. I was thinking a wearable might be a good idea but i really don't know.

I would love any advice anyone has."
How is everyone doing with making sure their kids are doing their online classes?? I keep getting messages from the guidance counselor that some of their work has not been turned in.  I’m finding this whole situation very frustrating!
I'm looking to place a hook near the ceiling of the car to hang an IV for my toddler who (a) needs a feeding tube (b) needs a stomach pump (gastroparesis) when she eats to avoid vomiting. We have stated to go on road trips (but before the quantine stared) we had to change her car seat and the IV wasn't at the right height anymore. This might be too specific a question but advice is welcome!
"Are there any toy ideas for a child who seems to destroy everything he gets his hands on? I know he's not doing it in a malicious manner, I think he's just curious as to how things works. I'm looking for toys that will help spark his curiosity. Something that will keep him occupied. He's the type of 5 year old that squeezes sun protector all over his toy slide and smear it with his hands. Squeezes it in his little pool so he can mix it with a stick. He breaks toys by taking then apart. Any suggestions besides legos is more than welcome. He's 5 by the way."
"My 6yo has minimal patience, and I'm not sure how to help him. We try to model patience, and I remind him every day that being patient shows kindness and respect, but nothing is improving. Any ideas?

For instance, in our Zoom class this morning, all 15 kids were sharing something they made. He was excited to show his creation, and like the other kids he raised his hand waiting to be called on. When he wasn't the first called he said, ""Oh come on!"" and slumped back, looking dejected. Then he would gather himself again and raise his hand, getting increasingly agitated when not called on. The other kids just stayed in the shot with their hands raised, but I had to encourage him to gather himself after each disappointment, ""It's ok. Your turn will come. Look what Julia brought!"" etc. After the 10th kid he just ran away and I had to calmly bring him back.

At other times he won't stop fiddling. He has a really hard time receiving direction and paying attention for more than a brief period. Instead he'll search for something nearby and start playing. I keep his ""work area"" clear before class, free from distraction, and I've found that giving him one small thing to hold is better than nothing. He has had difficulty sitting still since he was 3.

This kid is going to have a really hard time in 1st grade if he can't figure this out before the Fall. Without patience he doesn't persevere, and without persevering he isn't learning as he should. He is behind and only drifting further, and I have no idea how to help him.

My 4yo is naturally patient, so I know some kids struggle much more than others. I have to believe my older can improve given the right parenting.

Thank you, kind folks."
"Ok I need some advice lol how do you get your older daughter to understand that sometimes we grow up at diff ages with no set schedule. My younger Daughter let’s call her S older M
So S is very mature for her age always has been she can focus and is very determined. I always make sure to praise reward on her good behavior. Recently it’s been a tit for Tat!!!! M is on a kick now oh S is the golden child and goes off on a tantrum. M has ADD and also a learning disability so things take more time for her to understand. S I have a feeling is about to also start puberty I just know it. M not even close at all she is super immature for her age. I don’t want to not reward S for doing good things but I’m nervous in fear M will go off on a tantrum. I have already punished M once over this because she crossed the line with it. Go figure M’s friends some are already well into puberty and she can care less. Hearing her younger sister is there my god don’t bring it up. I didn’t think it would be this big of a deal boy I was wrong. I fear the day S starts her period before M ugh keeps me up at night. I am trying to see and understand both sides. I was a late bloomer so I’m shocked puberty would even start for her at 11. I know it’s a phase but I don’t want it to become something else and S suffers for growing up because her older sister can’t handle it. I did feel bad putting M on a punishment but there has to be a line or respect I can’t allow that.  Sorry for the long dragged out post any info advice would help. Thanks."
"DD (19) avoids exercising as if running a lap once in a while will give her COVID 19. I think a large part of this is because of her early negative experience with sports. Her middle school was basically mini-Sparta and would force the kids to run a 5K every week (?!) and graded the kids based on ridiculous activities, like how fast they could climb a 15 ft long metal pole (?!!) or juggle three balls (?!!!!!). As a result, DD got a C in middle school PE even though she was a Straight A student otherwise. 

DH also forced her to play soccer for five years, which DD hated the entire time and only quit after I threatened to divorce DH if he didn’t let her quit. DH has been calling her a sore quitter ever since, which I think adds to her anti-athletic attitude. Not to say she was athletic in the first place (she’s so incredibly slow and uncoordinated), but it certainly doesn’t encourage it! I’ve noticed DD hasn’t been physically active at ALL in the past four years, so she’s gotten super gross and overweight (BMI 26). I took her to my pilates class last summer, and she was SO exasperatingly slow and lazy it made me want to scream at her right there in front of the instructor (who kept giving her side-eyes because of how DD was obviously BSing the exercises). 

Ever since quarantine has occurred, the extent to which DD refuses to move is astonishing. She doesn’t even want to get out of the house to walk around the block once in a while, and sure as hell won’t accompany me on my runs. I’m just concerned this laziness and aversion to physical activity will stick with DD for the rest of her life, and she’ll get even fatter and develop serious health concerns. Does anyone have ANY advice as to how the fuck we can get DD up and moving? We’ve tried it all: soccer, basketball, softball, swim, tennis, ice skating, dance classes, taekwondo, pilates, running, hiking, even just walking... and she hates EVERY single one of them!"
"So my kids are 7 and 8. They spent time living with their dad and soon it’ll be my time again. But I’m in a city now where I have no friends or family.... I’m an introvert and I’ve just been working and doing school. When the kids were younger we had daycare but now they’re too old for it. There’s before and after school care programs but what to do people do during the summer while youre at work?

So for single people taking on parenting while working..... in Canada.... what is it you do? 
I’m thinking maybe camps but.... quarantine"
"Does anyone know of any kids or toddler grad or furniture resale apps or websites? I’m looking for a table and toddler chairs for my sons room, and have some things I’d like to get rid of as well. TIA!"
"We have a three week old. He hasn't slept much at all in the past 24 hours. He's on and off about 20 minutes at a time and super fussy. We have tried everything: pacifier, different swaddles, our baby rocker, feeding, changing, burping. No idea what is wrong. Can anyone help?"
"I guess I’m not really asking for advice but I’m about to make a decision and I feel very badly about it. I have a husband and two kids, 11 and 13. We have been social isolating very strictly, more so than most I think. Mostly because I got very sick over a year ago, a respiratory illness lead to me having a stroke. So I’m cautious to say the least. Both my kids have friends with birthdays coming up. I feel so much empathy for isolated kids figuring out how to celebrate right now.

One family is my best friend who is also strictly social isolating mostly because she’s naturally very introverted. Her son and my son are friends and he has a birthday soon. I love her but we parent very differently. We both live on acreages in areas with no other kids in walking distance. So I’m used to being very proactive, driving my kids around town to see friends, organizing events, volunteering at school, getting to know other parents. She doesn’t do these things much so her kids are very reliant on people being dropped off at their house or other parents inviting them to things. Which is fine, they’re very independent kids. They invited my son over for a sleepover as a birthday celebration.

The other family is a woman I know through school (she’s also super active involved parent) and her daughter is friends with my daughter. They announced for the birthday they will be driving from friends’ house to friends’ house to drop off cookies (professionally made so no one has touched) and we can decide how much socializing we feel comfortable with. I love this idea because they can stay on our patio for a visit and we can hangout without getting to close. Also this family has been allowing lots of random kids into their home because they are in an area with lots of blue collar, 2 working parent homes and kids alone in apartments all day. So not a lot of isolation going on. I really appreciate their consideration. And I admire their selflessly opening up their home to these kids.

My daughter is often sad because she will hear about her friends getting together at this home and she feels left out. I explain to her that she is very lucky to have room to roam and lots of exploring the country and these kids who are stuck alone in an apartment need to weigh their mental health against possible risks. Good answer but still hard for a kid.

I told my son I’m not going to approve the sleepover because I don’t know if that is frowned upon right now. Most people I’ve mentioned it to have reacted negatively, like “I don’t think you’re supposed to do that yet” He was understanding, I’m so blessed with a mature young man.

At the same time if I approve the sleepover because risk is low suddenly my daughter sees her brother having sleepover, her friends getting together and she’s isolated on the farm with only her baby ducks and chicks for company. If I open up sleepovers for one kid I have to for both.

My problem is telling my friend. She’s going to be offended, she and her son are going to feel that I am keeping him from having a fun birthday. I just fear that’s how they’ll react. I just wish she’d get active and plan something else. Like a social distance bike ride through a park, where kids can come and hangout. But that would require phone calls to parents and organizing location etc. Which I don’t know if she’ll do. I hate being in this situation. I just really don’t want to get sick again."
"First time mom and my 9 month son is driving me crazy with his screaming. Grandparents think it’s cute and funny, but they are not with him 24/7. I can’t even open the windows because it sounds like I am murdering him. He screams at the top of his lungs when he is happy, upset, tired, hungry. family members call him Pterodactyl. He is a great baby overall very laid back sleeps through the night.  Is there anything I can do to teach him about inside voices this young?"
I have seen people upset about how their baby's grandparents always buy gifts for the kids without telling them. I just want to know why that is upsetting
"My 3 year old daughter occasionally (and casually) uses the F word as an adverb (whats F’ing wrong with you). And when I ask her to repeat herself (so that I can ...positively ... discipline), she’ll say “it’s foggy outside”. We may have let it slip here and there (sometimes so natural to use F’ing for emphasis) *pls don’t judge*. 

I mean, it’s very funny (and cute) but at the same time as ever worried when she starts going to school!!! What have you done to discipline or rid them of the habit?!"
"I have thousands of videos and pics of my two boys over the last five years. My phone is full, google drive is full, copied onto my laptop and desktop.   


I can easily print the ""good"" pics (half the stuff I snap pics of isn't worth printing, only sharing). Put them in an album, enjoy.  


But what to do with all of the videos? I have 10 second clips of cuteness, minute-long clips only a mother could love.   


How do I transform all of this data into a meaningful memory?"
"Hello everyone! 
My step-daugter, aged 12, made an account (three accounts actually with her other siblings email accounts) on Hogwarts in Here. I looked up the site and it is for 16 year old+. You have communication with all other users including the ability to upload videos and pictures. I don't feel comfortable with that level of access at her age. I hear too many horror stories about kids being manipulated online. 

Does anyone have experience with Hogwarts is Here? 

Thanks!"
"Question!!! #1. How do we go about bringing his water for his bottles? Are we allowed to bring bottled waters or do we have to get them on the flight or when we land? We use room temperature water, so I’d hate to only have refrigerated water available, as I do not know how he would react to it. Also, his formula and his rice? We buy the 12.4oz similac formula cans and 8oz gerber rice.

 #2. We have some beach toys here at our house. Is it worth it to take them with us or wait until we get there and go to Walmart and buy some cheap ones? 



Now on to the point of this post:



We are going on vacation May 24th-29th (booked before all of this craziness started going on). 

We will be flying American Airlines. Our first flight is a little over an hour. Less than an hour layover, and then another hour flight to our destination. Same schedule coming back. 

We will be taking our 6 year old (I am not worried about him) and our 7 month old. Our 7 month old is pretty chill. He hardly ever cries. He likes to people watch. However, I did not buy him a seat of his own so he will have to sit on one of our laps (I have read that we could take his car seat on the flight if there is an available seat next to one of ours, but I put our seats together and my oldest son’s seat with my mom). So I plan on checking his car seat at the gate. 
He likes to be rocked to sleep. We have a rocker here at the house and that is how I get him to sleep for his naps and to put him down at night. I feel his car seat will be extremely useful on this trip specifically because of that. 
Now, these flights are not that long. The longest being an hour and 15 mins. I am just not sure how long he will sit in one of our laps before he gets irritated. What could we do to keep him entertained?

"Firstly Apologies for the long post, i'm hoping this is the right place for this.

To be a little bit more specific I'm a guy and my step child  is a boy (he's nearly 9) and he still has his real Dad in his life.

His father is not a great role model for him, without basically insulting him constantly in this post he's basically an alcoholic, although anyone on here who is from the UK will understand the drinking culture we have and that there's no such thing as drinking to much. He treats his son like a ""Mate"" rather than a son he's also quite manipulative so we're not sure what he might be saying to him when other people are not around (we've had experience with this in the past with him)

So he goes to see his Dad roughly 2-3 days by sleeping at his Aunties (Dads sister). My partner is still reasonably good friends with his Auntie and I get along with her too which is why we know exactly what goes on when he's with his father. There two or so days consist of his Dad sitting in a separate room with a separate TV drinking himself into oblivion whilst watching Football (soccer) whilst my step son plays on his xbox in another room for most of the two days, (they might kick the ball about  in the garden for 10 minutes occasionally).

His Dads sisters and his one brother (he's one of four) ignore &amp; excuse his drinking behaviour all the way because he's family, and ignore everything that comes with an alcohol addiction, the selfish behaviour etc lack of consideration for others the people skills, manners, etc.To compound this problem his Dad never tries to teach any of these skills to his son and his Dads siblings don't attempt to teach or correct his behaviour because they believe it's his Dads responsibility.

What I think is happening is because he's going to see his Dad over the weekend and he's letting him run Riot (and obviously he his Dad) he thinks that's how his life should be. Obviously when he's back home with me and his mother we're really the only two in his life trying to teach him any sort of life skills and he just doesn't want to listen, also we're not sure what his father is saying to him which is a cause for concern because he's a bitter and manipulative person in general (or can be)

I gather he's young and a boy so this might just be me worrying to much, but I do fear that he'll have no real decent life skills i.e. manners, consideration for others, diligence etc.

Thanks for any advice I get."
"I have been trying not to feel too jealous of all the people without kids who get to do stuff like watch movies, play Animal Crossing (why is everyone doing that RN?) and making forts together, but then I think what [i]would[/i] be doing without my kiddo around? Maybe rewatching my favorite movies, making crafts to mail to faraway friends, cleaning/reorganizing closets and weird nooks around the house.

Let’s dream big! If you were magically without your kids for even one week of quarantine, what would you want to do?"
"My hubby gets up for work every morning and all the noise wakes up my 7 month old. I used to think she naturally woke up at this time. But I've been keeping track of her cycles for sleep training and I know she's being woken up mid-cycle.

I've told him to be quiet countless times. He has adjusted things here and there to be quieter but he just still makes noise and pretty much couldn't be quieter. 

What do you guys do about this? I know I can't be the only one."
We have an almost seven year old and almost 3 year old. They love playing together but the seven year old is always coming up with games that end up with her younger brother getting hurt. He loves her so much he just shrugs it off and they go back to it. She hasn’t done any lasting damage yet but...
"Just a little background info to set the stage.

I left my wife of 5 years about a year and a half ago for many reasons. Basically, she's a manipulative, poisonous person that I believe has a borderline personality disorder, depression etc. It was toxic, I got out for me and my son.

I have moved on and am in a really great relationship. We recently got a place together and have my 6 year old son probably 60-75% of the time depending on  the month and what drama his mom has going on.

My son is really adjusting well in his new space and seems generally content. The one issue I am dealing with is the massive difference between households and how to navigate that with him. At his moms house its like the friggin wild west. She lets the kids ( she has another 13 year old boy, who to be frank is a little asshole due to lack of parenting) basically do what they want. Her other kid hangs out on media all day, stays up as late as he wants etc. My son, from what he tells me, is pretty much the same. Stays up past midnight watching his iPad, doesn't make him brush his teeth regularly, just lack of general household rules etc. It's the bare minimum ""parenting"" at all times.

At my house it's the opposite. I have a daily schedule for him that he checks off with his basic stuff on there. Wake up, get dressed, brush teeth etc. He earns media time by doing learning activities and his daily stuff. He has outside play time and playtime set aside for us throughout the day. I interact with him a lot.  He generally does well but I **constantly** have to battle with him to make it through his daily routine all because of one thing... "" *Mom doesn't make me do this, I hate the rules at this house*"".  Every day, all day its push back about everything. Most days he's a little grouch as I guide him through his routine. It's exhausting.

I currently navigate this by explaining to him that the things we do are healthy normal things he should be doing throughout the day. Just because he doesn't do them at his moms doesn't mean he shouldn't do them. I'm trying to teach him to be accountable and do the right things. I sure as hell don't want him growing up to be like his step brother.

So, question parents of split households and even just in general.  What has worked with you to get the focus off what he doesn't do at his other home? How do you normalize a day without so much push back, is that even possible?"
"Back in mid March, when they first closed schools and set mid April as a re-opening date, we assumed that date would be missed. And it was, and so was the next, until they finally said no more classes this school year.
By this point in the year, we normally have our 4 kids signed up for their preferred summer camps. Now I am watching some of these camps announce that they won’t open at all this summer, and I’m starting to worry the rest will move that way. Wife isn’t sure she wants kids going to camp anyway, but they’re all in great health and data so far suggests risks to them from Covid are negligible.
Going on 2 months of working from home while helping to manage a full house, not sure I can handle another 4. Anyone else struggling with summer camp planning?"
"Hello lovely parents! Hope you're all staying somewhat sane during these crazy times. I have been on maternity leave since October, scheduled to return 3-30-20, but due to COVID worked sporadically for a month while trying to wrangle toddler &amp; new baby (now 7MO) and opted to take unpaid leave of absence for the next 2 months, as my family is being relocated, and I don't have childcare available anyways.

Possibly slightly pertinent information, as I never had intended to be a SAHM and now I've been thrust into the situation after being a working mother for the last 3+ years. My toddler will be 4 in August and is ridiculously smart, sweet and imaginative. However, he's recently started apologizing for every little thing that happens, if he thinks I may possibly be upset about it. 

Recently, he has had a few incidents of peeing in the tub instead of the toilet (which we're fine with during bath time, but this is just randomly throughout the day - leaving dried up urine in the tub), and peed on his floor twice this week. He's been fully potty trained for over a year (minus nighttime), but has peed on the floor in the past as an act of aggression, though it's been a very long time. I tried to be understanding of him possibly just having an accident the first time... but then he peed in the same spot again the same day. He said he wanted to help me clean it, and I really tried hard not to lose my cool. I explained to him that I was frustrated and asked why he peed on the floor a second time, to which he just responded ""I'm sorry, mommy""... today he knocked over a bowl of water we were using to grow some little dinosaurs in, my cup of coffee (outside - thankfully), and just does a lot of mildly inconvenient, toddler-y things like flinging crumbs all over the place when I ask him to take his plate to the kitchen. He is constantly apologizing though, regardless of my reaction. If I even look at him, and he thinks I may possibly be upset he apologizes. I feel like I'm being too hard on him, possibly, but I don't honestly know the best way to get through to him in regards to just being aware of his surroundings.

I think some of it may be because we are completely just flying by the seat of our pants lately. He goes to bed around 8:30-9:30, and wakes up sometime between 8:30-9:30 in the morning. He does quiet time for an hour or naps every day roughly around the same time (1:30p), but otherwise we don't have a set routine and I've been just letting him get the sleep he needs and trying to adjust to being a SAHM to 2 small children. He's been getting a TON of TV time, especially in the last month as I was still attempting to work remotely... but I would *really* like to reduce this down to an hour or so per day &amp; introduce more structure into our lives. How do you do it? How do you keep calm? I would really appreciate any resources or first-hand experiences, as I feel completely lost right now."
"I need advice. My 11yo step daughter hates her BM’s new baby (her half sister). The baby is about 8m and she acts as if she doesn’t exist. She never has anything positive about her. For the longest time she called it a toe, yup like the appendage on your foot. SD doesn’t call her this to the baby or to BM. But she tells us this and we do what we can to tell her that language won’t be tolerated. We hold her to this standard with anyone she might be referring to. You don’t have to like/love people, but you will treat and show them respect. 

BM forced her into attending the baby shower by telling her they were driving somewhere, and then just ‘surprising’ her. She also told the kiddo she was coming out to see her for her birthday. (They live 3 states over, we have SD for the summer and holidays.) BM and stepdad did see her and took her to dinner for her birthday, but she also planned the baby shower here at the same time she came to see the kiddo. 

I don’t know how to help her. I allow her to vent all of her negative feelings about the baby because I know she doesn’t have anyone to talk to about it. But I do my best to make sure she doesn’t call the baby names, to remind her that the baby didn’t have a choice as to what house it was born into and that the baby hasn’t personally done anything to hurt her intentionally. 

I’m trying to find a way to help her through this, while teaching her that change is inevitable, but how you react and deal with it is what’s really important. She used to hate me too, five years later she loves me and we get along great. I’m hoping time will help with this too."
"My son used to sleep from 8pm-8am every night basically since he was 8 months old. We had some rough nights, and the occasional early wake up, but it always evened itself out.

He's almost 15 months old now, and has consistently been waking up around 5:45am and fighting sleep at night (usually not completely falling asleep until 9). 

I have an app that follows wake windows that we go with. We have nap and bedtime routines that we've stuck to since sleep training him (Ferber method). I know that as kids get older they need less sleep, but to go from 12 hrs a night to 8 hours in the span of a few days, it feels like something may be off.

Does anyone have any advice/insight as to why this might be happening? We moved the last week of March but we've been here for a month now. Do we try only having 1 nap a day? The last time we did that he got overtired and wouldn't nap."
I was coming home early from work and saw my 11yo son on his bike talking to his friends. They didn't see me. My son was coming home and before he left to cross the street he gave his friends the middle finger. He did it so nonchalantly that I couldn't figure out why he did it. My son is normally laid back. He doesn't cuss or act out. I don't know whether to laugh or to ignore or address it.
"Do you ever just look into those big beautiful eyes you created, listening to all their questions, all their curiosities and imagination journeys and just think....”HOLY HELL, SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR 30 SECONDS PLEASE”???

It’s one of those days - pray for my sanity."
"Did anyone else have a successful solution for this? Recently my son has been getting his leg stuck in the crib slats and today he got it stuck stuck. I got it out and he cried for a good 10 minutes after, I looked it over and it seems fine. He was walking (holding the coffee table as he’s not entirely walking on his own yet) on it and crawling around and it didn’t seem to bother him. I of course turned to google for advice and what I read was to A) put bumpers in the crib which I feel he’ll just pull on and put his leg over, the reason why we took them off in the first place B) put him in a sleep sack but I feel he’s too old for that and he’ll donk his head even more than he already does and C) move him to a toddler bed, he’s a crazy sleeper and I just have a feeling it’s going to be hard to keep him in it/put him to bed. Should we just bite the bullet and move him to his toddler bed? Our temporary solution was to have him sleep in his pack n play, we fixed it to where there’s no way for him to flip it over because we were scared (thanks again internet) he’d roll it and break his arm...please help! Lol any advice is very appreciated!! &lt;3"
"Half of this is to rant but I could use some actual advice too.

Currently, my husband works full time and I'm a sahm who takes the occasional odd job (I'm a graphic designer and teach English online very part time so I work maybe 5hrs a week). We have a 2yo boy and a 4yo girl. 

I feel I cut my husband A LOT of slack since he brings home the bacon but I am so tired of being in charge of kids and house 24/7. 

His only chores are putting the food away after I cook dinner, taking the trash to the curb, and doing his own laundry. He has given our daughter maybe 5 baths in her life and changed a couple handfuls of diapers between the two. I am in charge of planning all birthdays, buying all presents, scheduling all doctor and dentist apps, choosing her preschool, buying their clothes, making and serving 3 meals a day, grocery shopping, all housework, and making sure our kids stay mentally and physically active and stimulated.

On top of that if I want a date night I have to plan it. Holidays are hit or miss but most of the time he doesn't get or plan anything.

Yes I've talked to him about this before but nothing seems to stick. When I tell him I need a break he turns it around and says he never gets a break or he's tired all the time.

I try to tell myself I'm content bc he pays the bills and I should be happy my kids are my job but I'm not.

Is this normal? Full time workers, do you still help your spouse out at home? 

(I feel like I should add he is a good dad when he's around and he does show me affection. Massages and little texts throughout the day, it's not all bad. But dangit I'm at my wits end)."
"I've been dating this man for 4 years and he recently proposed. I have a 13yo old daughter and she started calling him dad after he proposed. I asked her not to because he wasn't her real father and her bio dad probably wouldn't be okay with it, see my ex died when she was just 5months so she never knew him. I don't want her to call my fiance dad because I feel like that role cannot be replaced.

She cried after I told her that and I feel bad and I'm doubting I should have said that"
"Hi! 
Just wanting some ideas on how to keep a 14wo entertained all day? 

He is a serial catnapper, so there is plenty of awake time. He doesn’t like going for walks in the pram/stroller and even car rides are challenging. I think I need to do it more to get him used to it, but I get so anxious about taking him out that I just decide to stay home. 

He is a beautiful boy, just hard to constantly find ways of keeping him entertained without being carried around all day. 

Thank you! Any advice is much appreciated."
"Today I caught my Dad trying to introduce E , my daughter to the Alien franchise.  After realizing what was going on I asked him to turn it off.  He then proceeded to argue with me about why it was okay.  I had to tell him six times that “I don’t care!  Alien is not appropriate for a three year old.”

Aliens is one of the most f-ing scary a$$ movies that I’ve ever seen.  I’m assuming that’s because it came out in 86 and I was watching that shit at 5.

Sometimes I just want to strangle my Dad."
"I know it's kind of a common joke but does anyone know if there's specific research about kids really acting differently in different situations or with different caregivers? I'm at SAHM and have always been my 9 year old son's main caregiver. Now that he's out of school and we're having to do our schoolwork at home and he doesn't get to see his friends I'm the emotional dumping ground. I always read that I'm the 'safe space' and so that's why I get the worst of the behavior, but my husband thinks I'm a sucker and need to toughen up on him. Does anyone know of any real empirical research about this topic? I'm mostly just curious as we muddle through it all."
"I’ve never experienced stress on this level. I am a hardcore perfectionist and I can’t handle that I’m doing such a shitty job on all fronts. I’m being an awful mother - screaming at the kids all day long like some demonic harridan. Doing a wretchedly shit job of my actual job, which involves immense responsibility and management of staff who are also stressed out. Fighting with my husband all day over whose teleconference is more important and who is more deserving of a break. I just feel like I can’t do this. And there’s not one fucking thing I can do about it. I’m already getting up at the crack of dawn to get a couple minutes of silence a day. I’m already going for long walks after they go to bed. Now all the cancellation emails are coming from their summer camps and I just feel panic-stricken. No point to this post at all, I just needed to get it off my chest.

*** this is the ultimate Reddit cliche but I’m editing to add a huge thank you to all the commenters. You have no idea how helpful it is to just know I’m not alone. I’ve always prided myself on being able to handle whatever comes at me, but hearing from others how impossible this is, I reached out to my boss and said I want Monday’s and Friday’s off until this is over!"
"Its 2:40 am and my son is still screaming. 

He just turned 6 months old and we started sleep training following the Ferber method last Sunday, April 26. Prior to this, he was sleeping for an hour and an half at a time all night long and it was killing my wife and I. We had great success initially, he would cry for a few minutes but was usually asleep after about 10 minutes and would sleep through to the morning, only waking up once to eat and then right back down.

In the last four days it's gotten so much worse. He now is back to waking up every two hours and screams for over an hour every time. Like fucking screaming, not crying and falling asleep, screaming himself hoarse without end. He's not not hungry, the room is dark, has white noise, and is a comfortable temperature. 

We are at our wits end and of course I'm the bad guy for  convincing my wife that this was a good idea. Anyone who's had kids fight sleep training like this, what do we do? Keep pushing and expect it to get better? Give up and try again in a few weeks? Are we doing something wrong? Any help appreciated."
"I’ve been thinking about a deep (philosophical) issue for a while as a new parent. It’s about being a working parent, how you internally went through the trade off between pursuing a successful career and spending more time with child(ren). 

Without sounding too haughty and with humility, I have a rather accomplished background. I went to top tier undergrad and grad schools and have had a long career from public accounting to investment banking on Wall Street. I recently took a huge pay cut and jumped across to working for a corporation that offers me a much better work-life balance but not as rewarding as my prior positions. I feel like I can do more with my career but have come to appreciate the extra time with my newborn — something I couldn’t have gotten before. The extra time not only comes in the form of the less gruelling nature of the job, but also my ability to accomplish projects in probably half the time as my peers at work. This efficiency has given me the opportunity to leave work earlier to spend time with my baby. 

The heart of my inner dilemma is what should I be valuing more:

(1) a rewarding and high earning career to save up for the best for my baby; it would probably take me at least 10 years to make it to a high position where I would have more work-life balance (if at all) or

(2) a satisfactory career and earning a modest living but spending more quality time involved with my child‘s growth and upbringing. 

Just wanted to see if anyone have / had a similar turning point in life and how you weighed your pros and cons."
"....as he sitting next to me... 

I never feel like I have the appropriate response. I don’t want to just dismiss it, but also don’t know how to explain it better to him. And it’s not a one time thing, he’ll say it often while we are home together. 

Can’t say I miss you too, because while you are crawling on my back, I don’t miss you :P"
"I know that my thoughts are not logical. I know I’m being petty, jealous and selfish. 
I really really do. And I talk myself down everytime my insecurities get the best of me and I end up thinking these things. 
My children (5 and 9 years old) split their time between their dad and I in a very unique way. Dad and I are best friends. Actual best friends. We talk daily. We hang out. We get along great, and I can’t imagine my life without him in it. 
He has a girlfriend, who I really do love. She’s sweet, caring, great with my children. She has never overstepped any boundaries, yet treats them as her own. Her and I have somewhat of a friendship as well. We have hung out to go shopping, texted here and there. She’s come over and hung out with the kids and I while their dad was at work. 
The problem is, I get so irrationally jealous at times of my children’s relationship with her. I don’t get me wrong, I love that they have someone else in their lives that is good to them and that they’re comfortable with. The fact is that there is going to be someone there, and I’m lucky that it’s her, and not someone who doesn’t treat my children well. 
There are so many times though, especially lately, that my insecurities get the best of me. I start to think everytime my kids say they wanna go to their dads, that it’s because they prefer being with her. She gave my kids some toys and I immediately thought, well now they’ll prefer her over me. She’s just trying to win them over to keep their dad around. I 100% know that this is wrong and untrue. But it doesn’t stop these thoughts from eating me alive at times. 
On Mother’s Day this year, I have to work. So the boys will be with their dad. He’s told me to come get them after work, take them any other day I choose, whatever I want to do to celebrate Mother’s Day. 
I should be grateful that him and I aren’t fighting over custody and that I have the opportunity to take the kids anytime I want, even if it’s not my scheduled day. Instead, I’m sitting here upset thinking, well this girl gets Mother’s Day with MY kids, and I don’t. She hasn’t mentioned it. I’m not even sure she knows that it is Mother’s Day. She never asks for time for herself with them. She just treats them well and plays with them and helps take care of them when they’re at their dads.
I know I am crazy. I know I’m just having irrational, insecure thoughts.
Reassure me please."
"I’m a FTM with a 7 week old at home. I have always been a heavy sleeper and had insomnia for several years. Since becoming pregnant I have stopped my ambien. I am able to fall asleep now without it but it takes awhile, and then I fall into a deep sleep. Everyone told me not to worry because mom instincts would kick in and I’d become a light sleeper. They were wrong, her crying isn’t waking me up at all. I have been staying up until 5am, and then my husband has been taking over until I wake up. If I try to sleep when she sleeps I don’t wake up when she starts to cry. He was off work due to being sick but is going back soon. I however will be off for another 7 weeks. 

For at least the next 7 weeks I need to make sure I am waking up during the night so my husband can sleep for work. The monitor right now isn’t nearly loud enough, we have vtech dm221. Ideally I would like a monitor with two parent units to keep one in the downstairs living room during the day. However we could always use the one we have for that and use the other for me during the night. If anyone else has other recommendations to what could help I’d appreciate it!"
"Hey!

My husband and I are trying to brainstorm ways to split parenting responsibilities. What do you/have you done to keep things even and keep fighting at bay? (We understand there will be stuff that happens no matter what).

We're looking for any age range and any situation. Maybe bed time routines, maybe a hack for weekend getaways, shopping, dinner time... Legit anything and any age. Where you feel you kinda hacked it and made a plan that works for you.

Update - I'm not looking to split things like say my husband always has to give every bath and I have to do every diaper. More in general what kind of tools do you use to split these parenting responsibilities in the moments or at certain events. Like maybe for example me and my husband have made the decision that who's ever friend event it is that person gets to drink and the other person is always going to be the sober driver. Of course this doesn't always 100% happen but in general it's kind of our guideline. So I was kind of looking for more those things lol. 

Thanks!!"
"Hi, I'm a young parent to my girlfriend's daughter and she has been asking me about games i used to play when i was her age, does anyone know where i can dowload old reader rabbit or scholastic educational games to show her. Thank you in advanced"
"The school has three different portals/platforms, just start there - it's confusing for my son, let alone me, he gets irate if I try and help.  My son is also dyslexic, he is hideously disorganized, a gamer, he has 'F's' all over the place, is dreadfully behind with missing assignments, misses his online appointments with teachers aides.  When I try to remind, give a nudge he sometimes lies and says he has done the meeting, but mostly he forgets, even if I reminded him ten minutes before.  
Since quarantine I haven't been giving him his meds, maybe I should be giving them, the thing that he is missing is the heavy supervision from school, something that he will not accept from me at all.  He already is learning compromised, I don't want our days to be continual screaming matches by forcing myself upon him, but he is desperate, he sat there today with a useless math screen up, clicking over and over again just shooting for anything to get the correct answer as he did this his eyes were full of tears.  I can't help him with math, it's literally beyond me, but I can help with Biology and English and other studies, but he is rejecting me.  I try and keep very patient, don't engage when he gets mad...

His Directed Studies teacher told me she is going to get him extra accommodations because Distance Learning is very hard for him.

Does anyone have any suggestions or experience to offer?"
"I have the impression that my 2 years old son only have fun when he's destroying things.

He have a big box full of toy cars, lego and other toys but he only turns it upside down and trow the toys all over the place. Then he proceed to smack the toys into the ground or walls.

He opens the wardrobe and trow all clothes on the ground. He have broke many furtinures by climbing on it, dragging arround or hitting with other things.

He screams a lot when we try to control him, he trow things in the ground, slam doors and hit us. His behaviour is very stressfull for us. 

I'm working full time from home, so I can't monitor him all the time. My wife needs to split her time between our 9 years old daughter and domestic duties like cooking and cleaning. After I disconnect from work, I give my full attention to him and try to help my wife with the house, like washing dishes and etc. 

My wife and I cry sometimes of exhaustion and we don't know what to do. We took him to a child neurologist and he was taking 3 drops of Risperidone, but there was no visible improvement and with the pandemic the doctor canceled all the appointments so I don't know when I'll be able to see the doctor again.

Sometimes I just want to sleep."
"Our two year old son still sleeps with a pacifier. I don't know how to go about taking it, I have tried a new stuffed animal, and rewards. Should I just let him cry it out and assure him he's okay, and ideas?"
"My son is due to start prek this August and the school in our district is terribly rated (2 out of 10 in most categories including student comprehension, test scores etc) as are most of the public schools in our area. We had planned to be moved to a different area by the time he needed to be enrolled but now because of the pandemic and my partner being on furlough we have missed the opportunity to move to a better district in time to get our son in school. Many of the pre-k's in the districts we would prefer are on a first come first serve basis so even if we get moved in the next couple month most programs are already full. While I would love to be able to shell out for private prek it just isn't in the cards for us right now. 


So the question is do we go ahead and enroll him in a terribly rated school (one we havent and may not be able to tour until school starts due to the pandemic) so he can be around other children and developed some socialisation skills or do we keep him home since prek is not mandatory? 


We are first time parents and he is our only child so all of this is new to us. We want to do right by him and I know he desperately wants to make friends but he has also already expressed concern for being away from home. I'm worried if it is a stressful environment for him it may scar him for the next better school he will have. School was very difficult and gave me a lot of anxiety so of course I am worried about his experience because I want so much better for him than what it felt like for me. And while I'm at it how do I cope with him going to school?!


Help?"
"I have a 4 month old boy and my wife and I want to start sleep training. We are looking at the Ferber method. My main question is: Do we perform the method on EVERY sleep time? As in, nighttime, night wakes, naps, everything? Or do we start one or the other first?

Thanks!"
I know a lot of parents get their kids music lessons. Thinking about doing the same for my LOs. Why did you (or didn’t you) get your kids music lessons? Is it worth it? And what’s a good age to start?
"My 13 month old keeps throwing his spoon and fork on the floor. We are trying to teach him to use utensils so we keep retrieving them over and over during each meal. Does anyone else have this problem, and are there any ways to prevent?"
"Hello ,

So I have a almost 3 week old girl. It has been a pretty rediculous ride so far as me and my wife have 0 kid experience and our daughter is actually the first baby we have both held. My main question is I as the dad have been doing most of the leading on the new parent hood. My wife is really only feeding the baby then wants me to take as soon as she is done so I can burp and put her down to sleep. So other than breast feeding i have been doing diaper changes, baths, burping, walking around all hours of the night to get her to sleep , walking around during the day while trying to work and do conference calls while she spends time on the internet or napping. It seems she likes the idea of having a kid by doing research about things on the internet but when it comes to actually parenting she doesn't really want to be involved. Due to this I feel as I am starting to hate this and regret having this kid in the first place. Any advice would help as I am starting to get a little fed up with this kid. Thanks."
"It almost seems like her problem is she simply Doesn't Want to Talk to us. Occasionally when she doesn't think we're watching, we'll see her sing along to a song on TV, but will stop if she catches us. She seems able to understand what we're saying to her, as she does respond when we ask her to go somewhere, or to stop doing something. She's expressive when she wants something, like she'll bring us a drink or food item when she wants us to open it and give it to her, but only in gestures, not words. She even knows when we're talking about her, as we catch a smirk when she doesn't think we're watching, and she knows when she's doing something she's not supposed to, cause she'll first check if we're looking at her, to see if she can get away with it. She is vocal, but only baby babble, she won't tell us what she wants, she might show us what she wants, and gesture what she wants, but not in words. It seems like she's too shy to let anyone hear her speak. She knows her numbers up to 20, and can arrange them along the floor, she knows most of her ABCs as well. She even knows how to spell certain words. I know we're getting through to her, but she won't talk to us. We were 2 weeks away from an appointment for getting her evaluated when the pandemic hit, now we're stuck. We will likely take her to speech therapy after the evaluation whenever we can get another appointment, but in the meantime, I have to do my best from home. Any ideas on how we might coax her out? I appreciate any insight"
"I’ve heard numerous opinions from family and friends about how I should potty train my son. He just turned 2 last week. I have a little talking Elmo potty that has a “flush” handle and also a seat over the big toilet. We also have training pants and pull ups. I’ve read him potty training books and we’ve watched cartoons about going to the potty. I’m not sure if he’s interested, but I don’t know where, when or how to start."
"Wondering if anyone has been in the same scenario and if it has worked out for them/how it worked out. 
My ex and I share custody of our 3 year old. 
However, I recently started a relationship with someone from another country who has two kids. Is there anyone else in a similar scenario where it has worked out? Needing advice on how to share custody but live elsewhere.... could it be something like half the year with one parent half the year with another?
Please try not to be mean. I want what’s best for my child."
"My dad is a wonderful and super involved Grandpa. He’s 70. My daughter isn’t quite a year old and she’s half Caucasian, half Indian (my hubby is Indian). 

Ever since my daughter was born, during family get togethers, my dad will comment at least once, if not 2-3 times on my daughters’ skin tone. Things like comparing her to her cousins, some of which are very fair. He’ll joke that they don’t look related.

I know he says these things without thinking or without meaning harm and I know if I say something, he will feel I’m too sensitive and being defensive. When my daughter was a newborn, I was like whatever about it but it’s literally every get together he will say something! Before covid, my fam would get together like twice a month or more. When my daughter is a little older, I don’t want her to feel any which way other than positive about being half Indian. Why is her skin even a topic of convo? She’s apart of the family, end of story. 

Tell me your honest opinion if I’m being overly sensitive or have a valid point. The other issue is how to bring this to his attention without causing negative feelings. I’ve already mentioned how I feel to my mom and she said she could try to say something to him about it."
"Can a 6 month old be trained to be a heavier sleeper? She wakes up to almost every noise and it’s causing fights in the house because I tell people they need to be quieter/turn their music down etc. 

I’ve heard some babies are just born light sleepers and it can’t be changed"
My plan for my wife for mother's day is to give her the day off. I'm going to cook a brunch for us and then me and my 3yo son are going to clear out and let her have the day to her self. Problem is the weather is supposed to be absolutely miserable in my area that day. Any thoughts on what we can do indoors to give my wife some peace and quiet?
"Ever since this lock down my seven year old girl hasn't been listening. Time outs aren't working, taking away privileges (phone/video games). I'm not sure what else to do. I'm against spanking but I've been yelling a lot and I hate it. I know it's not going to help. Please give me suggestions and ways to calm myself from yelling."
"Have any of you had luck getting a child to wean off of their thumb? Is it worth doing ? I didn’t care until COVID, but now it would be great to minimize the germs my kid (4yo) puts in his mouth!"
"So my ex and I were together for 4 years. We have a 15 month old daughter together. Our relationship was very emotionally, mentally, and financially abusive. 

I finally got out. 

When we were together, I was so blind that I let my credit tank to try and build his up. His ended up getting higher than mine so he bought a house in his name only that we lived in. We had gotten loans together and had a credit card together (total of $15k debt). Well, since we have split the baby and I are living with my mom to save money until October. He’s still living in his house. He owns his car and essentially has no bills and makes $14/hr. He hasn’t paid me a dime in child support other than $50 out of his $4,000 tax refund. Well, here’s the kicker. 

He has filed bankruptcy. He is keeping his house though but now our combined debt is ALL on me. I was trying to cut him a break and not file for child support but now I don’t care. I’m so angry at myself for letting a man drag me down like this. 
I’m trying to be the best mom I can be and he only sees our baby once a week. I feel like he has gotten off SO EASY and I’m just here drowning... 

(I do have a great job and make great money, so I’ll be ok- it’s just very frustrating)

Being a single mom is tough, especially when you carry so much resentment for the kid’s father. Anyone been through this? I’d appreciate any advice or kind words as I am not in a good mindset right now!!"
"My daughter turns 4 in late December and I just found out if I want her in Pre-K I should've applied already. I thought it would be next year but what do I know? The other problem is that both myself and my wife work 9 to 5 jobs. My parents watch my daughter in a different district and I'm not sure how to handle her application. Am I allowed to apply for a school in my parents district since they will be the ones dropping her off and picking her up? If I have to apply in my own district, what are my options?"
"Ok, so I have 3 kids that are enrolled in a Spanish immersion school (it is a public school that was assigned to our address). My husband is Iu Mien (descendant of asian whole other story) and speaks his native tongue as well as English. The kids understand his language but do not speak it and he doesn’t necessarily encourage them to speak it. 

So now that we are homeschooling, whenever it comes to the Spanish portion of the curriculum, he starts interjecting his native language, from behind his WFH computer. I feel it’s distracting and not helping them to focus on the Spanish part of their curriculum, but I don’t speak any other language so I could be wrong. They maybe able to pick up both at the same time. 

So I guess my question is 2 parts. First, I wonder why is he waiting to teach them til they are engaged in another language? I can ask him but want to get some other perspectives first. 2nd can this interfere with their learning or enhance it? I don’t want to bring it up to him if my concerns are not really valid."
"I'm curious to see what child care options working parents are utilizing. I have a school aged child and schools are closed here for the remainder of the school year. Both my husband and I work similar daytime hours, Monday through Friday. I have the luxury of teleworking.. but I know that is not an option for some parents. Our child care is only open to 0 to 4 year olds at the moment. Hopefully they will open soon for 5 and up. 

What arrangements do you have for your kids? I can't help but think of working parents that are put between a rock and a hard place due to the pandemic."
"We got our 5 year old son a pet Tortoise for his birthday and he was thrilled.  In true 5 year old fashioned he names the tortoise ""Cheeseburger"".  We seriously take care of this silly little turtle every single day.  I think being locked in quarantine it has given us something to do.

Well today it was 90 degrees out so I was out in the front yard letting the Cheeseburger the Tortoise walk free to get some exercises.  After awhile I decided to water some plants.  Watering some plants let to watering a lot of plants which led to me going in the backyard to tend to something else.  About 15 minutes later my husband came out and asked ""Where is Cheeseburger"". I had completely forgot he was even outside.

We searched and searched the whole yard, the neighbors yard, and even the house after that.  We looked until it got too dark to look anymore.

I know it's just a little tortoise but I feel so so horrible.  I lost my only child's first ever pet and it's entirely my fault."
"My 2 teen boys, 14&amp;15 have cut off all communication with me. There’s no real reason why, they have just become like most people now a days they don’t answer my calls and texts. Their mother has made it a point to seek revenge by using them, and her latest fiasco has been making a rule that if they leave the house with me then when they return they have to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks in their room, as if they need to spend more time in their rooms, and have to use gloves and masks when they go downstairs. I want to take them to the park play basketball, mtn biking, running, things like that, especially now when they don’t have school and need to have their minds stimulated. What are some ways that I can remedy this?"
"Hi! We are a little over a month away from doubling our kid count. 

With all the changes and attention my son has been missing out on while we work and manage child care, I wanted to get him a nice ‘big brother’ gift for when his baby sister arrives. 

Ideally this would be something that encourages independent play. He will be 3 years old when she arrives. 

Likes:
- cars movie 
- trucks (dump trucks, construction trucks, etc)
- Star Wars (getting a lightsaber for his birthday though) 
- books 
- being outside 

Doesn’t seem to love / spend a lot of time:
- drawing / coloring 
- Playdoh"
What are some games or exercises I could give my soon to be 1 year old boy? Working full time at home so looking for self sustainable ideas. I feel bad that I'm not giving him enough to do.
Ok so my girlfriend pumps every 3 hours for my son. And at night she skips one and doubles up for the one in the morning so she can get 6 hours. She is always tired because even with the 6 hour stretch she has to still be up at like midnight. So I told her maybe she should double up the one at 9 pm and then double up at 6 am. That way she gets that whole time to rest. I’m the one that takes care of him at night so she could definitely sleep through it. She was concerned about her supply dropping. When I told her that idea. It’s a big concern because our son was born 14 weeks early so she doesn’t get enough for the full feed. Would my idea work or is that a bad idea?
"I have 3 kids, ages 5 and almost 2 (twins) and am newt divorced. I will preface this by saying that I am a young mom (24) as well. Today I was given the option to have a uterine ablation done, mostly to help stop my extremely heavy and irregular periods, but to also prevent future pregnancies. That being said, how does one make that decision to take having more kids completely off the table? I love my kids to death but mother of God this shit is overwhelming and if we’re being honest, I don’t love being a parent. I do it because I have to and because I love my kids but I don’t truly enjoy it. I wish I was one of those people who did. I do, however, love being pregnant and having a newborn, but I’m trying not to take that into consideration. I am completely overwhelmed with the 3 kids I have now, so most days I can’t fathom adding another to the mix. I also think about meeting a new guy one day, entering a serious relationship. What if he wants kids of his own? What if I change my mind once my little kids get older? Will I want to have a baby in the house again one day? Those who have made the decision to end their ability to naturally conceive more children, what “sold” you on that choice?"
"Hi all! I'm a parent to 3 beautiful kiddos :) Could not ask for better children and I love them all equally. They are: (15F), (7F) and (6F), the oldest is technically not mine but I have raised her since she was 5 and I see her as my child because of this and because her mama is not actually in the picture. Well she is sometimes but she has trouble keeping a job and moves around a lot so she never sees her kiddo and doesn't call except on her birthday (and I mean *her* birthday, not kiddo's!), she has never been to a school function, has never bought her anything and doesn't pay child support, she had not seen her child in 3 years until last week.

Last week she moved back to our state and called wanting to speak to daughter and I asked why all of a sudden and she got real mad at me for that, said it's none of my business and what not. I later talked to daughter about it and of course she was really happy because she's a sweet kid and loves her mother despite the fact that her mother doesn't actually mother. She's now convinced her mother has finally realized what she's been missing out on and thinks she's ready to be her mom.

I cried in my room later because despite all I've done for this child she still doesn't see me as her mom, no, that title apparently goes to the woman who pops up once every 3 years and then leaves without so much as a goodbye and never bothers to call to check in or ask if she needs anything. I'm always going to be second best to this woman, I'm not worthy of being mom, I'm just [my first name], daddy's girlfriend.

My struggle is constant. My step kid is Asian and I'm half white half black so people are surprised to learn I'm actually in charge of her or related in any way, then you have the racist grandparents and the teen angst that makes her somewhat ashamed to have a stepmom. It's like sometimes I don't have the right to be there with her and it sucks, like I can only observe from far away if that makes sense haha.

I love her so much, I just wish things were easier. I wish her mother were nice and didn't leave all the time breaking her heart and leaving me to pick up the pieces. I wish she appreciated me more :( is that too much to ask?

What can I do to make it hurt less?"
"Hi All! Interested to hear some feedback from people on here regarding sleep training for a 9 month old. My SO is worried that our 9mo isn’t falling asleep on his own for naps/bedtime and that us holding/rocking him to sleep is creating an issue. 

Were you still having to hold your baby till they passed out? If so, when did you stop needing to do this?

Thanks!"
"My awesome kids are 9, 11, and 13. I was single and childless until I married their dad two years ago, so I'm still pretty new to parenting. I honestly, have great kids. I love them, and they love me. They were really rough around the edges at first, being raised by a dad with really didn't care about things like table manners. Obviously, I didn't raise them. Which is probably the main reason we butt heads about a lot of things. They just don't understand why they should be careful with things. 

I was raised in a house where you were not allowed to do things to break things on purpose. Like rock in chairs, or treat them like they are play toys. Or squash, or rip things apart just for fun. My kids love to rock chairs around, lean in them, or do anything else that I was trained not to do when I was young, because it loosens and breaks the chairs. When their dad notices, he stops it, and gets after them; there used to be a lot more kitchen chairs, but they have broken the rest. 

Any time my kids are around a chair, they put their foot on it somewhere. I tell them over and over not to. Especially since they put one foot on the part that goes between the chair legs, grab the back of the chair, and rock it around. Which is one reason why all the chairs in the house are wobbly... I've mostly gotten them out of tipping it like that, at least when I'm around. But they still try and stand up on the supports between the legs. (I don't know the official term for those things.)

They have to stand on a kitchen chair to put some of the dishes away. Today, my 9 year old tried to stay up on it while leaning on the counter with one hand, tipping it over with the other, and shifting it to the side to move it. Which is not only unsafe for the chair, but unsafe for them.

When I ask the kids not to do things like body slam each other on the ottoman, they act confused. They don't understand why they shouldn't. I actually banned them from touching the ottoman for a few days last week because they wouldn't stop dragging the ottoman across the room for fun. I've only been telling them they can't do that for two years. (It scratches the wooden floor, and one of them always tries to flop on it before the other one gets it to its destination.) I give them reasons, and they look at me like I just started speaking in a foreign language. Sometimes (But not as often as before.) they immediately go back to it if I'm not around, like I haven't been telling them the same thing for the last two years. (That's another thing... I am so sick of, ""I didn't know that!!!"" and ""I didn't mean to!!!"" that I want to scream. I feel like they are old enough to understand and be more careful of certain things. When one of them does something they shouldn't, the other two screech to them loudly enough for me to hear, so they actually know, and get reminders. 

Maybe I just need better consequences? I'm so outnumbered by them at times, I can't constantly watch all three of them as they go about their business in different parts of the house, AND get things done around here. I feel like I would be a completely different parent to them at this age if I had raised them from the beginning. But I have to go back to simple basics like ""don't smash the furniture"" instead of just letting them do their thing. 

Thank you for reading this, I know this was sort of rambling. I haven't left the house much in the last few weeks, to be in contact with a lot of other parents, and I can't complain about my kids to my kids. My husband just tells me I'm right, but he doesn't know how to deal with it. (He also doesn't care as much as I do about it, or notice it as much as I do.)"
"My son is 4.5 mos and has a lot of trouble with naps. Right now he is a great night sleeper. Once i put him down he has one feed in the middle of the night but other then that doesn’t wake up till morning. But naps, 30-40 minutes 4 times and day and he won’t even attempt to self soothe like he does at night. I’m not really a fan of the crying (especially since I’m by myself and won’t have extra support during the day) but we have to do something. I know that we will still have to reinforce any sleep training at night as well but I was wondering if anyone did well nap training with Ferber?"
"I’m a single mom alone quarantined with my son who just turned one on May 1st. I’m teaching full time. His dad sees him, but rarely. It’s starting to wear on me. He’s at the stage where he cries if I tell him no, or don’t let him do something. I haven’t had human contact with anyone but my son in 2 months. Oh! I’m also working full time. So today I was in the bathroom with my son (of course) and he knocked over my new glass top scale and I said “no!” Really loudly and he started crying, and then I started crying. It was a mess. I’m a mess, and he’s a mess. Anyone else in the same boat? I feel like I’m never just down because when he’s asleep, I’m doing all the work I couldn’t do during the day, or laundry or cleaning. The struggle is real. I’m just coming to vent, because I feel like there’s no end in sight."
"The room is soooo bright at bedtime (7pm) and the light is only lasting longer since sunset is getting later.

The blackout blind and curtains let too much light in around the edges so they're basically useless. So what do I do? 

We've put scarfs and covers around the edges before we got the blackout blind but we really thought the blind would work. Is there an alternative to draping random items of fabric around the entire window or do we accept that it's our only option?"
"We are expecting our second child in the fall. Baby #2’s due date is two days earlier than our older daughter’s due date was. She ended up coming after her due date, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that happened again. 

Either way, these two little girls will be close to exactly four years apart. Their birthdays will most likely be either very close, or maybe two weeks apart. (I guess there’s a small chance this one could arrive early and their birthday’s may be a month apart, in which case I assume this is a non-issue). 

How do we make sure our girls feel special and unique even with close/shared birthdays? I already had to fight hard to make sure this second little one didn’t end up with a similar name to the first. I imagine the four year age gap might help us, but I honestly don’t know what to expect.

I especially want to make sure our older daughter doesn’t feel robbed of her birthday this year. We will likely have a brand new baby on her birthday, and I don’t want the excitement of that to eclipse her big day!

Anyone with a similar situation have experience or suggestions to share?"
"So I put my 3 year old almost 4 on a time out and sat next to her door. I told her she couldnt come out until she apologized. From the all I hear is ""mommy, I'm not playing this game with you!"" 
I couldnt stop myself I was laughing so hard. I say that almost everytime i chase her down for something."
"We’ve got an extremely hungry 19 month old boy on our hands, and want to know if anyone out there has had similar experiences or advice to share. Here’s a little bit of info about him. I’ve shared this between r/parenting and r/askparents, so I’m sorry if you’ve stumbled across this twice. 

He’s in the 98th percentile for height and weight, has excellent learning and development, and is a generally happy and fun little guy. But he’s hungry. So hungry, it’s a concern for us. We feed him well, he eats great food and there aren’t any vegetables, grains, meats etc he doesn’t like or not regularly eat. He has well thought out servings of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. But.. it’s not enough. We’ve tried increasing his protein intake further and it’s still not enough. It may or may not be early to be concerned about it, but we don’t want to have an overweight kid. My whole side of the family struggle with weight, whereas my wife’s are slim - if his genetics are more aligned to my family then this is a reasonable concern. This isn’t a new thing, it has been his whole life so far (milk through to solids) and we’ve waited to see if it calmed down, but here we are.

This may very well be exacerbated by being in lockdown and stuck at home, but it’s also not something unique to this time. He’s not bored, we’re doing activities constantly and playing around. Between every meal he’s constantly asking for more food - and rattles off every food word he knows while trying to get our attention (moves chairs in to the kitchen to try get in to cupboards, gets his plates or bowls out to show us he wants more food) and gets extremely angry when we don’t give in to his demands. He wakes up and says banana. He’s not hungry, or at least he shouldn’t be - believe me when I say he eats more than enough, and it’s wholesome food! No junk food, sugars, only water etc. 

Eating itself is a whole other issue, it’s like he’s worried about the food being taken away so he eats insanely (worryingly) fast to the point he might choke while eating, all the while putting more food in his mouth. This is probably part of the same issue, but honestly if this was the only issue and he wasn’t always hungry between meals then it would seem like this was an okay challenge to work through - but not both at the same time. 

He’s obsessed with food down to pulling recipe books off shelves (specifically cooking books, he doesn’t touch the other books) so he can bring them to us and open them up on a page to show us the food. He’s obsessed with food to the point where when we’re having a family dinner and he (always) finishes first the rest of our own meal becomes a fight for survival while we try to finish our dinner as he’s trying to eat ours. My wife has snacks hiding in the pantry so he doesn’t see her and want some. 

This just didn’t seem normal and we want to see who else out there has had a similar experience. What did you do? Did this pass? 

Thanks for reading this far :)"
"Title is pretty self explanatory. My son is three and likes me to take baths with him. Is it weird that his mother is in the bath tub with him? I don’t mind it and he like it, and it’s obviously not sexual in any ways. I just wanted to hear others opinion. Thanks!"
"I had my first when I was a teenager, whos dad left me days after I gave birth. I got pregnant again a few years later, after a long term relationshipx, and the father left me when he found out I was pregnant. I then spent a few wonderful years as a family with my two kids and a new partner. We bought a house, we were engaged. He then told me he wanted to have another child, who was born 3 months ago, and baby daddy number 3 has now also left me. He said it was all too much and he’s just realised he doesn’t want kids. After spending years with me and my children from previous relationships, after sticking by me through my pregnancy, after telling me he wanted a baby. 

So now I have 3 kids, by 3 different fathers, who have all left me. I’m struggling a lot with the children. I never thought I’d be doing this alone. Especially since number 3 was planned. 

Now I watch from the sidelines as the fathers to my kids achieve amazing things, going to university getting great jobs and going on amazing holidays, going through girlfriend after girlfriend. And I’m here, raising the kids, without even an hour to myself at any time. 

I know I know. Woe is me. But today I’m finding it hard. When does this get Easier? When does life get fair? 

I look after my children as well as I can, I always have done. I love them so so so much. I just feel like I’m not enough, I feel like they’re going to be so embarrassed at school when people find out they’ve all got different dads. I feel so sad for them that I’ve bought them into a situation like this. 



TDLR - 3 kids. 3 diff dads. No help from any of them. I’m struggling. I feel like an awful parent."
"I just wanted to share.  My kids are 1, 5, and 7. They all like them. The 5 and 7 year old can open as many as they want without me getting stuck in an endless loop of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as each child finishes one and requests another. If I put an entire 10 pack in the snack bowl, they won't need anything from me until dinner.  


Just in case any telecommuting parents forgot about these wonders."
"Hi all

I was wondering if anyone had any advice? I have an awesome 3 y/o and my husband and I generally go for a positive reinforcement method when it comes to parenting. We don't spank and feel like time outs should only be used a tool to remove our kid from a situation that is causing him to freak out. He's pretty well behaved and we're pretty happy with everything.

One thing I am struggling with is how to address misbehavior at bedtime. Typically my husband and I switch off laying with him until he falls asleep each night. We enjoy being close with him and he loves having us there. He knows when its bedtime he should lay in his bed and try to sleep. For the past 2 weeks when it's my turn to put our son to bed, he immediately gets up and starts to attempt playing/being silly/etc with me, even after I remind him that it's bed time. I started leaving the room (after a warning) for about 5 minutes and then try again. But he's been seeming afraid that I'll leave him each night at bed and seems worried about the idea.

I don't want him to feel that I don't want to be around him and that he only gets love when he behaves. But I have no idea how else to address it. He only really does this with me for the last 2 weeks, and goes to sleep without too much issue on my husband's nights. So I don't think he's needing a later bedtime. 

Basically, am I damaging my kid and is there a better way to work on this?

Edit - a word"
"To make a long story short, he seems to have extreme difficulty grasping that what may be fun for him is not necessarily fun for other people. As an example, when he plays Minecraft with other people, he will get bored and start killing/griefing the other people he is playing with. Griefing just means making things more difficult, so if someone is trying to accomplish something, he will make accomplishing that thing much more difficult, or will destroy the thing they have finished. I have explained this to him time and time again but nothing seems to stick. 

What is really bizarre to me is that he has a friend he plays with often that does the exact same thing to him, and he hates it. But he puts up with it because he doesn't want to upset his friend. 

I want him, so badly, to be able to play with other people but he, for whatever reason, hasn't taken to the advice I have been giving (or trying to give, maybe) him. 

Any advice would he appreciated."
"I'm probably being overly dramatic here but I need some input on things.. my youngest daughter just turned 8, it's just me, her 9 year old sister who has Autism, and she has her father, his wife and 2 step kids. 
Her best friend lives behind us and I let them play constantly. I think it was a great get away from having to be in her crowded house at her father's, and feeling she needs to take care of my oldest's special needs. She can actually be a little girl with her bestie.
Last weekend I wanted to spend some quality time with her. I set up some activites with just me and her to sew a dress and paint a birdhouse. All she could think about is going to the neighbors. I didn't want to force her to spend time with me, but at the same time my feelings were crushed. I'm not handling this well... I know she's getting older and more independent, I didn't have my mom in my life so I can't compare to how she feels. 

What should I do? Should I let her just play with the neighbor? Should I force her to spend time with me? I'm lost...."
"Wife and I have a 5 and a 1.5 year old. I haven't stopped working in all this, having one of the essential jobs, but on a very limited schedule. Basically a week on/week off. My wife works retail and started next week is allowed to start going back to work. Our schools are closed for the year and no daycare until the end of June.

I have no friends that can watch them, nothing open to send them to, barely any PTO to take. I don't know what we're supposed to do.

Why are they basically saying screw you to all parents who work?"
"TW: description of injury to a child

Yesterday was the scariest day of my wife's and my life. I was outside with my 8 year old stepson, MIL, and the dog. I was wrangling the dog when I heard my MIL yell, and when I turned around, I saw my stepson face down in the dirt at the bottom of the front porch, not moving. MIL said he fell off the porch. I ran over and he was still not moving. At this point, my wife heard the commotion and ran outside to where we were.

We rolled our son over and he had a blank look and a mouthful of dirt. He suddenly started seizing. He has had febrile seizures a handful of times before, but never randomly or due to an injury. We immediately knew this was serious. My wife tried to position him so he wouldn't hurt himself while I called 911. I did my best to comfort my wife and MIL while talking to the 911 operator. I don't know how long our son was seizing, couldn't have been more than a minute or two, but it felt like forever. My MIL was hysterical and my wife was sobbing while she did her best to tend to our son, but she must have felt so helpless.

He finally stopped convulsing, and very gradually started coming to. We could hear the ambulance in the distance at this point (thankfully, we live about 5 minutes from the nearest ER.) Our little guy never changed color much, he was breathing normally once he started coming out of the seizure. Once he started coming out, he instinctively started twirling his hair with one of his fingers, and we all kind of nervously laughed with relief because that's one of his most common absent-minded habits and we knew our little guy was still in there. He tried to talk and move but we kept him still and calm.

The paramedics were great, so kind and helpful to our son and us. They put a neck brace on him, loaded him into the ambulance, and my wife rode with them to the hospital as my MIL and I followed behind.

Of course, due to the coronavirus, they would only let one family member into the hospital with him, so my wife was with him while his grandparents, his dad, and I waited on a bench outside, waiting for word of his condition.

Ultimately, they did a CT scan, checked for concussion, and miraculously, they did not see any damage, bleeding, or any signs of a concussion. He was just very tired from the seizure, which he always has been after having a febrile seizure. The doctors believe that since he has a family history of seizure disorders, he may just have a lower threshold for what injury would cause a seizure, so even an injury that's not severe might cause a seizure for him. I was so relieved when I heard he was alright. He was eventually discharged and we all went home. Once home, he took a nap while we stayed close by (the docs said we didn't need to keep him awake or anything, but we wanted to be safe.)

When he woke up, he said he thought it all was a dream. He has no memory of falling, just of being in the ambulance and the hospital.

Even though we now know he's going to be alright, it has been a rollercoaster of emotions ever since the accident. Yesterday after he came home, my wife kept alternating between feeling totally numb and crying her eyes out. I love my stepson like he is my own blood, but I've only been in his life for the past 3 years and I know my emotions can't compare to his biological mother's. Last night, she stayed up most of the night to keep checking on him. She said she was scared if she went to sleep, she'd wake up to him dead. She is better today, but still having waves of emotions and saying she keeps picturing him seizing in her mind.

As for myself, I feel like the emotions didn't really hit me until today. I know logically my stepson is okay, but I feel like the emotional equivalent of being hit by a truck. I feel so physically and psychologically drained, very on edge and emotionally raw. I feel like I have very little patience or tolerance for any emotional distress right now.

I'm trying to focus on easing my wife's emotional trauma from this incident. I feel like I can hang in there until she feels better, and then I can let go and process my own emotions. Maybe not the healthiest way to go about it, but I want to be strong for her because she seems to be struggling more than I am right now.

I guess I just needed to vent about what happened and what my wife and I are feeling. I want to know how to handle the emotions we are both having--how I can help her through this, and how I can deal with my own emotions. Thanks for reading."
"Hey guys just a quick vent and in need of some word of wisdom if you guys got some. 

First time parent here, daughter is 1 years old and a month. 

Now I know, I’m sucking it up. I’m manning up to the situation. I’m just having a moment of weakness. 

I know that my time will now be taken by this cute bundle of joy. But now I am just so frustrated cause I can’t find a free time for myself. 

Monday to Friday, I work then come home, help with the baby, then eat dinner and shower. Weekdays watch baby all day and nap when baby is napping. But now it feels like a constant cycle and it’s making me crazy. 

Even when I spoke to my wife that I need this time off, it feels like so much pressure to finish I can’t even enjoy the task. 

My hobby is making videos and podcast. I need to be in the room to do this, but I can’t concentrate with all the moving and crying. Then by the time the baby sleep at night I can’t make any noise to do my podcast. 

Because I can’t do my hobby I’m getting frustrated and fighting with my wife and being in a bad mood. 

I don’t want to go through this again. I’m really considering 1 and done. Any advice from parents here that got more than 1 child or learned how to have free time? 

Thanks"
"My 6 year old asked me this seemingly out of the blue tonight as I was tucking him into bed. It caught me off guard and I laughed a bit, but then I just felt sad for him. I explained that eventually there will be a vaccine made and things will go back to normal, but until then I just don’t know. 

He is an only child and has no cousins his age, so school was his main source of interaction with other kids. Outside of that, we would take him to the park after school every week. My spouse and I try our best to fill in the gaps for him with lots of play time but I know he really misses being with other children. I’m curious how other parents (especially of only children) are helping their kids understand the situation."
"I am so sick of my friend's rude remarks towards my son. He's 17 and on the shorter side (165 cm) and is likely done growing. His father is really tall but I'm really short and he got my height. I was talking with my friend yesterday and she asked me how my kids were doing and I told her they were doing fine. Then randomly she just had to talk about my son's height. She asked if he was still a shortie and if he had grown taller than her since quarantine. My friend is a bit on the taller side (she is a few inches taller than my son but shes not super tall, maybe 5'8). It's honestly so fucking rude to say that. My son is a wonderful man. He's handsome, intelligent, and so kind and compassionate but it sucks how she reduces him to just his height.

She isn't the only one either. So many people I've met have always talked about my son's height and they ask how he turned out ""so short"" despite his tall father. Its infuriating! My son is more than his fucking height.

I'm sorry but I just need to vent. I know my son will be fine and he hasn't let his height stop him from doing amazing things. There's plenty of girls out there who will love him and his height and I hope he never takes these comments to heart!"
"So you know how kids threaten to do something naughty when they aren't happy with you. It gets more serious through the years doesn't it and eventually, they use ""I'm going to run away"". Usually, around 10 years old I think. 

Well, heads up folks because after being told not to spit my FIVE-year-old is going to ""explode the world next week"". He obviously needs a little time to get prepared huh!"
"Thank you for all the post replies yesterday to https://old.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/gcpel3/is_anyone_elses_child_staying_up_all_night_during/

I go jogging at a park daily and left my daughter a note yesterday and she had been up until 10am from the previous night. The second I got to the park, my mother called and asked if she could borrow my pulse-ox for a family member (our town is sold out). I called my child and no answer. Texted, no answer. My mom said she was on her way to my house and my daughter did not answer her phone a total of 5 times. I needed her to let mom in and started worrying also.

I had to leave the park the second I got there and when I came home, I was shocked by what I found. I knocked on my child's door and no answer so I flung it open and her room was an absolute mess. There was a used sanitary product on the floor, her phone was next to it, and next to that was a SPILLED glass of full water. Inches from the phone.

When I woke her, she said it's ""not her fault"" the phone ringer was off. I took it from her.

I left the house and the note remained that I was at the park.

When I returned, I sat her down and explained that the up all night on the phone is unhealthy and I am worried for her. Here are the following responses:

""You never cared about my mental health before so why do you care now."". (not true)

""I have insomnia what do you expect me to do?"". (I offered tea and sleep aids and she started screaming and hitting herself)

""You're taking away my personal possessions and ruining my life"".

""I have lost all my friends now because of you"".

""Why do I have to apologize to you when you're the one taking my life away?"" (I told her I never asked for an apology)

""It's my life and my phone and you need to give it back now."".

I explained to her she is affecting other people with her all-nighters and she told me it's quarantine so ""who cares"". At one point in the conversation, she threatened to run away and then started hitting herself. She accused me of starving her and trapping her in her room all day when she came out while I was at the park and even took a shower while I was gone.

New day and she is still locked in her room by her own choice. I don't know what to do at this point. I feel our relationship is damaged to say the least.

Thanks all."
"Warning, long post. I don't know that anyone can help. I just need to get it out. I tried talking to my mom today, and she just started criticizing my husband and I for our parenting style. 

We have a 4 year old son, and he's SO energetic. He was in a preschool before COVID came along, and had some behavioral issues, but nothing major (mostly just normal kiddo stuff). When COVID hit, we pulled him out of school and both of us started working from home full time. 

I know it's hard on my son, everyone being stuck at home but not able to spend all our time playing with him. I've tried talking to him about why we have to work, why we can't go outside a lot or see anyone. He did well with his quarantine birthday, even though he was sad. 

We also recently moved to a new house. I worried for months before the move that he would take it hard. I talked to him EXTENSIVELY about how we were moving houses, he'd be changing schools, but highlighted the great things about the new house (bigger house, bigger rooms, better back yard). He got excited, and he loves the house. 

On to the actual issue: the past week since we moved in, he has been acting out hard. Just today, he tore up a toy, flooded the sink in his bathroom (causing water to flood the hall), threw things at the house from the backyard, and yelled at both of us

With punishment, I always start out calm. I tell him what I expect, and what behavior is unacceptable. I give him the chance to correct it, and escalate as needed when he doesn't. We don't believe in hitting of any kind. Taking toys away used to have an impact, but now he just doesn't care. I don't know what to do about this. I can't watch him every minute of the day because I'm working (or just worn out). Anytime I stop watching him, he does things he KNOWS he shouldn't. 

His new school MIGHT be opening on the 11th, but they don't even know if they'll be able to. I want to send him, so he's got a more stable routine and an outlet for his energy...but also worry about his possible exposure to the virus. It feels like there's no right choice here. 

I just want my son to be happy, and for our family to have fun together when we can :("
"My oldest daughter who is 4, is attached to me at the hip.  will literally be walking and turn around and she is right on my heels.  I feel like I am partly to blame as for the first 2 years of her life she slept next to me but then we then had two more kids, who also need my attention. I'm not sure how to break this. 

She is always wanting to hang on me, help with the little ones and I don't get any peace. Her and my 2 year old share a room together yet she still comes in my room in the middle of the night. I have tried taking her back to her bed and explaining that she needs to sleep in her room. She says she is scared and doesn't want to be alone. I've explained to her that she isn't alone, she has her sister. I've tried to talk to her about sleeping in her room and how it is good for her and for me. That will work for a few nights but then she is back to crawling in our bed. My other two children sleep in their own beds and on rare occasions do they end up in our bed.  

I do try to find time to spend with her coloring or playing but I'm so tired on not getting anytime to myself. I just need a few moments to process my activities for the day without interruption. I was an only child and I think having 4 kids is more difficult for me than I thought it would be. 

I love my children and wouldn't want to trade them for the world. I just want a few moments to myself."
"I live in a very small mohilr home. We have a teeny tiny yard, but we have not been able to use it because it is full off jagged rocks and.glass from previous tennet(we are.working on cleaning it up). My poor avtive 2 year old is now stuck inside. We have not been able to go on walks because I just gave birth and had a really bad tear and my 2 year old is immunocomprised and our neighbors are not apcial distanceing so he bolts towards them and Im not fast enough. What can I do to help ease his boredom by being stuck inside??  We paint and color and cook but not sure what else to do. We have like zero space and I just feel sp bad for him."
"Hi there, my daughter, who will turn 14 this year, is very interested in online video game. I am not concerned with addiction, but I am really concerned with the increase in sexism directed to female gamers, which is something I have seen quite often. 

We often play together, and I have no issue with that. The problem is, she begins to meet more friends in game and play in audio chat with them. The community of the game has quite a lot of toxic behaviors and inappropriate languages, so I am really troubled by this. Some random players will add her as friend and hope to play with her simply because of her voice. Who knows what they would do. 

I am hoping if you have any insights to address this matter. Thanks!"
"I'm a single parent of two adorable teens — a girl and a boy. My husband and I broke up 3 yrs ago. Now, I'm not really a stay-at-home mom. I work hard for my teens and I try my best to provide them with everything they need. However, due to the virus, I was forced to stay at home. I feel like my children feels that they are stuck with me during this trying times. I am not a good parent because I only know how to provide financially but never emotionally. We do not talk that much. I often feel awkward with them especially my daughter. She always turns a cold shoulder. I want to reach out but don't really know how and where to start. This corona virus thing slapped me BIG TIME as a parent."
"Hi everyone,

Due to circumstances beyond my control I've been forced to self isolate in a hotel room with my sister and two year old. We have a friend making a trip to the store for us tomorrow and wanted to ask what are some activities that we do to keep him entertained while here?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thanks for all of the helpful suggestions!"
"As the title suggests, currently just began decorating the room that was the nursery for our youngest into a bedroom for our oldest who is turning 7 in a month. He's had to share with middle kid until now but I made the call to give big man his own room and put the younger two in together now and got no objections from SO or the kids.

We've just painted the room up in his choice of colour, I let him help a little with this part. I was now going to shut the door and keep him out until the birthday so it'll be a huge surprise, new bed, desk, wall art, drawers, curtains etc. The alternative is to make it a project we do together.

Not sure which will have the bigger impact and leave better memories."
"He went out with dad whilst I have blitzed the house. Now I'm sat smugly in our clean house waiting eagerly for my fluffy boy to return!
I'm gonna cuddle him so muuuuuch and try and convince dad to hoover.
This is the first day in ages I've managed to achieve anything.
Anyone else got a new baby and struggling to achieve anything normal?"
"As the title. Grandfather wants to take our daughter to a overnight stay where they would essentially be beyond a drivable distance for the parents. No issue with grandparent want to take her on a trip or spend time. But the grandfather has no interest in doing anything locally and has the last few years basically not been involved more then family gathering. We asked him to take her for a luncheon or play-date in the park, But he feels it would be more fun with a 2 day trip. Mixed emotions, and I dont want my kids to miss out on their grandparent, but I also want to to be involved ""at home"" with play dates  or parks. We live withing 15 minutes, so there is no issue with opportunities to hang out."
"Hi,

My wife speaks Japanese, and I speak both English and Japanese fluently. I mentioned this in another post, but I will soon be re-integrating into my son's life as his father, fully. I think it's in all our best interest if I speak English with him and help him learn English, not only to make communication easier with me, but also for his future prospects-- knowing English and Japanese can get him a lot further in life than just English. He can do more things he would want to, I'd imagine, knowing English.

However, since he's our first kid, I don't have experience raising a child at all, let alone a child bilingually. Additionally, as it stands, he only speaks broken, 2.9-year old Japanese. Now, I would be totally fine just speaking Japanese with him, but like I said, I think it would be a disservice to both of us if I missed this opportunity to raise him bilingually. It's also a little weird because he already speaks one language a bit, so, I can't just talk at him in English over and over until he gets it... or can I?

What advice do you guys have for raising a child with English as his second language, particularly if he's already started with another one (Japanese) for nearly the first three years of his life?

Thanks!"
"Backstory: I have a 6 y/o boy who has never had a great bedtime routine. We bedshared until he was 3 and after that he still needed someone to lay with him until he fell asleep. 

Currently his bedtime varies from 7pm to 9pm. He wakes up 80% of the time and comes to our room in the wee hours to finish his sleep. This was all fine until we had our second child.  Now we are exhausted and at the end of our rope by the end of the day. 

We do bath time every night around the same time but that’s about it as far as routine is concerned. 

He has sensed our frustration and now bedtime is THE battle. He claims he is scared, hungry, thirsty, sad. Anything to prolong the bedtime routine. He sneaks out of his room after being laid down and tries to wake his baby brother up. Guys, I am loooosing it. 

Tl;dr 
Help. I want my child to go to sleep at the same time every night in his own bed with minimal parent interaction. My brain is zapped from newborn care and I literally cannot make a plan to help this happen."
"I have little kids aged 4 and 2 years old, Wife is working still and not at home. I am studying and trying my best to survive my current job and not able to pay any attention to my kids and feel really guilty. We are fortunate at mother in law is living with us trying to take care of my little children but she is old and her back hurts. 

I am not sure how to keeps my children busy and occupied while I can concentrate on working from home giving old mother inlaw some break to lie down and relax. It seems impossible and feels an utter failure. 

Son is only 4 and because of no attention, he already got addicted to TV and video games - I would say 8 hours a day. I cannot find any other way to make him occupied so that I can work in peace. I am worried about his eyes and addiction to games and TV at such early age. I tried hooking some good educational games on the computer for him but he is ONLY addicted to car racing. 

Anything you can recommend, games, or some interesting toys I can purchase for them?

Any recommendation on how to keep the balance so I can concentrate on work/ study from home and the kids can still thrive? It seems impossible to me. 

Thanks in advance!"
"My step-daughter, who lives abroad, has recently been punished for some naughty things which is off topic.  BUT point is she doesn't have any hobbies to fill the time.  Especially now since everyone is stuck in the house.  What are some hobbies you would suggest?  With all of your help I'm sure my husband can provide her with many options.  Thank you!"
"I tried to download app to Kindle fire, but I can only download the app and run in parent's account. That means the volume limitation app would not run in the kid interface?

I heard thousand times the following today already

head shoulder knee and toe, head shoulder knee and toe, head shoulder knee and toe, head shoulder knee and toe"
"Our little one (3F) sometimes flatly refuses to a request we make by saying 'nope' if she does not feel like it. It could be as simple as asking her to drink water.

But the same request if made with the offer of a present, she will gladly do it. So I understand her love language is receiving gifts but I dont feel like this is a good approach to bribe her with something every time we have a request...Is there a better way? Thanks!

"Need a long range video monitor that will reach the kids’ room upstairs from our room downstairs. 

Currently using the Wyze Cam but it keeps freezing in the middle of the night or losing connection. I’d like to go back to a non-WiFi baby monitor if I can find one that will reach that far. 

Plus, an actual monitor screen rather than my phone would be nice since I have to keep it on all night.

Thanks a bunch!"
"My Lo is 19 months old and she loves to socialise with other children. With everything that's going on obviously that's not possible right now.

Whenever we go on walks and she sees other kids, she tries to wave at them and get their attention. Or if she has a toy, she'll reach out with it, in an attempt to give it to them.

Seeing that little face fall when we have to move past the other kids, is honestly soul destroying.

Today while out back, she heard the neighbour's kids playing in their garden and she kept trying to laugh when they laughed, or stomp her feet when they jumped around. She kept looking at me and pointing to the fence, talking gibberish but obviously wanting to see the other children.

Her poor face when I tried to distract her or when I told her we could play with them later.

Any other parents dealing with feelings of guilt and sadness that their child is missing out? Or am I just odd?"
You can pair one set of AirPods with an Apple TV. So my wife and I each take one AirPod and we can watch movies together in complete silence while our daughter sleeps in the next room. It’s been a game changer during this quarantine. Every night we’re able to have movie date nights. I hope this helps anyone needing spouse time during the lock down.
"My daughter (24 months) typically goes to daycare three days a week, with my mom or MIL watching her one day a week. My parents, MIL, FIL, sister who lives with my parents - are all high risk. I’m still on the fence about going back to work (currently furloughed, retail, can’t work from home) and in what capacity... if I go back - she’d go to daycare three days a week, and I’m thinking I’d arrange to stay home that fourth day. I’m wondering if anyone has thought about grandparent interaction in the next year or so.


I don’t want to put any of the grandparents or my sister at risk. I know my daughter’s daycare will do all they can to make the space clean and safe, but toddlers can’t wear masks and they don’t really understand going on. She’s in a classroom with about 7-9 kids, and it’s a fairly small daycare, but with kids, teachers and all the parents there’s a lot of room for exposure. My mom would be heartbroken to not hug my daughter (only grandkid) for the foreseeable future, she’s having a really hard time at 50 days in. 

Am I overthinking this? Anyone else in a similar situation? Theoretically we could make do on one income (my partner will be working from home for a while) - but it’d be tight. I love my job and wanted to stay until I retired, but I can’t keep my daughter away from the grandparents!! They all live very close and my daughter really misses them.

I know the economy is total shit, I don’t want to throw my job away... but at what cost?"
"Hello Parents!
I am a new Mom to a lovely 10 month old, Ursula. I mostly have held off a bit with books so far. Following my instincts and keenly observing my daughter has worked great. She is a very happy girl and let’s me know in her ways when she is hungry, tired, bored, wants love or has to poop. 
Now though... I’m watching a gf with her 4 year old and it is making me quite anxious about the future. Enough for me to seek peer discussion on this. I find myself wondering as we enter Ursa’s toddler years, should I have a bag of tricks or routine to help things stay low drama? I am more into philosophies that are child led. My hope is help her to want to follow reasonable routines/rules. Easier said then done I am sure many can attest. That is my wish though, so I’ll reach for that!"
"I have an amazing two month old foster son. For the past two weeks or so, his daytime naps have been max 45 minutes before he starts fussing again, often more like 20. The 45 minute stretch really only happens once a day. He'll get progressively fussier throughout the day because he's clearly tired, but nothing we've tried will get him to nap more consistently or on any kind of predictable schedule. Any suggestions? If I read one more article that suggests blackout curtains I might start screaming and never stop."
"How's it going out there for other parents in this situation?

I've got an 8 year old daughter at home since March 13.  She quarantined with her dad and I (who were in the process of divorcing when this started.) for 3 weeks and then went to stay with her grandparents the last 3 weeks.  She's coming home this weekend.  I just feel so bad for her.  Her only contact outside of this bubble is her tablet.  
I'm working from home full time and dad is, well dad home but not exactly an entertainer. 

Just wondering what's working out there for other only kids stuck in this madness?"
"TW: anxiety, mentions of fear and panic attacks 


Over the last few months our toddler has grown so much. He always want be by mine or my husband's side. He's such a sweet, smart, sensitive little boy but it scares me almost..

I've never had someone who needed and looked up to me as much as our son. I have nightmares and panic attacks triggered by thoughts of ""what would happen if somthing happen to me?"" I didn't realize how much toddlers look up and need the adults in thier lives until now. I don't really know how to handle these feelings.  Its overwhelming. Does anyone worry about things like this?"
"My first time posting. My son is going to be 10 soon. My ex husband called him during his known designated school time to let his niece talk to my son. I was not happy about the timing but ok. I let it go. But she suddenly invited him to her wedding tomorrow. The drive is nearly 3 hours away and across a state border. I am working from home and can't take him down. 

How do I tell her that the timing sucks and that if she had reached out even a week or more ago I would love to have him be involved but with work and school there is no way.

She did offer to video chat from her phone but that still means him stepping away from his schoolwork and my new husband thinks that rewarding the situation is not a good idea and will only cause her to pull this again in the future."
"I have a 3rd &amp; 7th grader. I work a dental job and they reopened today but due to no childcare reopenings I didn’t return. 

I had my kids summer all mapped out with camps and now just don’t know what to think or do anymore. 

I don’t know if I want to go back to work in such a high exposure risk environment and know my office isn’t going to be a model for infection control at all and it will be extremely frustrating and unsafe.

At the same time I’m not sure I want my kids to go to camp even if it did open up there’s no way to have it and social distancing. The camps haven’t sent out any news.

And I’m just not sure my measly paycheck that we used for spending/fun money is worth the risk anymore. I understand how fortunate we are and things would definitely have to be tightened back up again and I have no problem doing that if it’s what’s best. 

So, what are other families planning to do? I was a SAHM before and went back to work when both my kids got to school age and I’m considering it again. Anyone else?"
"Hi everyone. This is my first reddit post ever so bare with me. I am a mom to a very strong willed 7 year old boy. We have a unconventional household, I’m 29 and we live with my dad and brother at dads house. My sons father is around and sees him most days. We split up a few years back but we try to get along and co-parent. We have our struggles still but it’s slowly working itself out. 

Anyway, so since the virus mess I have been working 40 hour weeks and have had zero energy when I get home. Just enough to make dinner most nights. The issue I am having now is with discipline. My son NEVER listens to anything I ask him to do anymore. He ignores me, kicks and screams when I ask him to do basic chores. It’s at the point were I don’t even want to try anymore because I’ll just end up crying. There are so many more factors going in this, too much to type. I’ve done time outs, I’ve taken things away. I guess I just need some advice..  I’m open to anything at this point. Thanks for reading"
We have had a hard time getting our 16 month to sleep forever. Husbands family lives 8 hours away and every single time we come home from a visit we have basically had to retrain her to sleep (which can happen 6-8 times a year). It has been so hard that I had just given up and let her sleep with a tired pregnant momma lately. We just restarted but this time we let her take a billion stuffed animals into bed with her. She loves it. She basically just moves them all around for a half hour and then falls asleep when she is ready. We also have an Alexa in her room and let her listen to Celtic Women (which she loves) and just turn it off when we see that she is asleep. No more crying for an hour to get her to bed (both me and her)! Our family is finally getting the sleep we need!
"Proud father of a 2.5 month old baby boy ! Love the little guy to death! But my furniture and all our clothes on the other hand do not. We've  got your round-of-the-mill spit ups stains, the pee stains, the poop stains , and milk stains. I really don't want to use any high powered bleach like cleaners unless absolutely necessary.  Does anyone have some good tips and tricks for getting these all out ?"
"I've got two high energy girls. We mostly shop at Target but the older they get the more than want to get ""grown up"" type clothes. Also, Target stuff doesn't really hold up. The leggings end up with holes after a day, etc. 

Any go to websites that you folks like? Thanks in advance."
"I need help with my 8 yo boy. He never had sleeping issues but 2-3 months ago he watched some scary videos at his mom's place and is scared to sleep alone ever since. At first, I accepted that he crawls into my bed at night when he wakes up scared (mistake I know). I slowly reduced the help to make him fall asleep and I'm now sitting on a chair in the hall until he falls asleep.

The problem is when I try to remove this crutch. He absolutely refuses to even TRY to fall asleep by himself, even if I tell him that I'll come back in 5 minutes if it doesn't work. He's refusing to make any effort. If I try to leave, he'll just leave his room and go downstairs. He will refuse to go back to his room. If I force him back, things escalate in a full-out tantrum where he will bite me, hit me, threaten to kill me, etc. I will hold the door shut so that he can't escape but he then breaks stuff in his room, kicks holes in the door, attack me if I try to intervene, etc.

This confrontation usually lasts a good 20-30 min until he loses steam. By this time I'm exhausted and I give in. I sit in the hall until he falls asleep. I just don't have the energy to go through another hell cycle.

If he wakes up at night, I will most often sit in the hall until he falls back asleep (can take more than one hour) but sometimes, like last night, I try to be firm and insist on him trying for at least 5 minutes alone. He refused so I locked myself into my room, trying to be firm. He banged into my door at midnight for a good 5-10 min until I had enough, was very pissed at him, and forced him to his room, which resulted in a full-out very violent tantrum. After things calmed down, I sat in the hall until he fell asleep. He won.

I don't know what to do anymore. Next step is putting a lock on his door and removing every breakable things in his room. That seems cruel but I don't know what to do anymore. Any other idea?

Some possibly relevant background info:

* Separated for 4 years
* 50/50 custody
* Mother is diagnosed BPD, two suicide attemps ~3 years ago (unknown to the kids)
* Mother's boyfriend also has temper control problems
* When I asked my son and his 11 yo sister why he does not do violent tantrums at his mom's place, they both replied because he's scared of them (of mom and boyfriend). He says they swear at him a lot.
* Mom denies that there's any underlying issue beyond ""he's a typical boy""
* Started seeing a psychologist 3-4 weeks ago but hasn't helped so far (no mother collaboration)
* He also has self esteem issues. He often says ""I'm not good"", ""I can't do this"". Suffers from comparison with his 11 yo sister, he's never as good at school, as nice, as good in sports, etc.
* Tends to give up very easily. Does not like to be challenged.
* These violent tantrums can also be triggered by other things that upset him, sometimes very petty.
* It's basically impossible to put him in timeout for any reason anymore, he will always refuse to go to his room. If I force him = full out violent tantrums. The only punishment that works is taking away the ipad for a day or two.
* I have a reward system in place (stars on a chart for good behavior/chores) but it's not enough to entice him to sleep alone
* His bedtime routine is always a good 15-20 min where we read a book together and then I give him a 3 min massage"
"Hey all.

My 5 month old baby is quite close to my mum, which is cool but lately I’m feeling progressively more and more possessive and annoyed at her. 

Whenever I try to put him to sleep or at the slightest cry she takes him out of my arms before I even get a second to try and calm him. 

I know she loves him a lot but being in lockdown together is starting to feel like a blessing and a curse. I enjoy the free time but I’d rather spend it with my baby, regardless of how tiring he can be.

Am I being unfair? Looking for some reassurance that my baby will still prefer me over anyone else."
"Hi! Never posted here before, figured I’d give it a shot. 

We have a 2.5 year old and 6 month old. 

Our boy, the 2.5 year old, I feel is excelling in most areas. It’s just that he’s been acting up a lot lately. 

The issue is that lately he’s constantly testing us - example: wife said to stop touching the table cloth with his dirty hand and he did the slow finger descent.

When we tell him to do something, my wife does a count - pick up the toy 1, pick up the toy 2... and he always waits for the 3. I’ve read that this trains him for exactly that. So I tell him to do something and give him a consequence like timeout. 

Issue there is that he has started to be un-phased by timeouts. I got some advice from my brother who does timeouts based on age: 2 = two minutes. I’ve thought about increasing this. 

The latest thing we’ve tried to get him in-line is getting out his baby seat for dinner and letting him act out, example: he can’t meow at the dinner table, but we let him do it in his baby chair and try to not pay attention. We just started this tonight and he was dying for attention. 

The thing that bothers me the most is when he takes away toys from his little sister, but we try to handle this whenever we see it. He still does it when we aren’t looking. 

I understand this might be made worse by quarantine, but we take him on walks and car rides almost every day. 

Any advice on how or if we can reel him in would be appreciated."
"I have 2 juniors and a freshman at home. they have been on remote instruction since mid march and the announcement was just made that the remainder of the school year will be remote instruction. they only have online school from 9am to 1pm and it’s only 4 classes a day. they started out the school year on the honor roll. their grades have dropped tremendously. they claim that since school is online only, the teachers are assigning too much work. i have such a hard time getting them to do their work and follow up with their teachers for help. i’ve tried money for grades as an incentive. and i’ve tried taking things away, such as their phones and no tv but nothing is working. what do i do?"
"My little girl will be three in a few days and she has been clinging to me a lot lately. She always wants me, she will get very upset if my wife tries to interact with her. 



My wife is due any day now with our 2nd child. I feel like this clinging is going to get worse when the baby comes home. How do I deal with this?"
"Distant learning is ruining mine and my daughters(6yr old) relationship. I am no teacher, I was home schooled and received little to no education. Anyone else seriously struggling right now? I'm having a difficult time remaining positive when I look to her future when she goes back to school."
"Hi , I just can’t get along with my kid 7 year old friends . Not always they throw tantrums , even if they are playing nicely I just don’t want to be part of it . I know she wants me to get involved which I do but not with her friends . Even a single girl I can’t manage . If they are at my home just feel like when will they leave , omg so much work is left . Just leave . I have single child so I shouldn’t behave like that but don’t know what is wrong with me . Please advice ."
"Finances are a little tight, but I think I've got the gift part covered. I just don't know how to make the day special for her being stuck at home. She's immunocompromised, so there's really no going out and doing anything even while maintaining distance/masks or whatever. She would absolutley not want to risk any part of it. We have a 3 YO and a 4 month old. So multiple naps a day for the little one and the 3 year old is going through her tyrant phase has made days constantly chaotic.

Obviously, I'd love to do everything I could to take the kids for the afternoon and let her do a spa day or a Mani/pedi or just about anything to relax and de-stress, but I don't know how much she'd want ""Time to herself"" while stuck in the same house we've been stuck in for the last two months. I'm WFH, but she's furloughed so she's been on constant Kid-duty and I know she needs a break from it. Realize most any ""Surprise"" will be hard to pull since she will be keenly aware of an absence since the only leaving the house we do is curbside grocery pick-up or drive-thru on occasion.

Right now all I can think of is maybe getting food from one of her favorite restaurants ahead of time to cook on the day, running her a bath, and letting her do a little home spa day while I put the kids down and maybe doing a massage or something.

Anyone else in this boat? Maybe have some creative ideas I'm missing?"
"Our son just had his 4 month check up, other than the shots it was a great visit lol. The dr said his head has mild flatness and depending on how it is at his six month check up he may need a helmet, and those aren’t covered by insurance she said :(. I thought we were doing good with his tummy time, he even began rolling tummy to back at 11 weeks. Any words of encouragement or advice to help our little guy not need a helmet :)"
"My oldest is in 5th grade, and since she was 3 her father and I have been seperated. Before, her schedule was 1 week with me, 1 week with her dad. Same schools since she was 3. Recently, she asked for 2 weeks with each parent, which we agreed to. The issue we are having, is that at her dads, he has to work and goes on her word that shes doing assignments (since remote learning). But she has been struggling with assignments. Upon closer inspection, she has been prepping for her assignment this week, for the past 2 weeks. At her dads. Shes struggling to do whats required of her, and I suspect that she hasnt been doing any of her classwork at her dads. Ive asked the teacher to tell me if she has been missing assignments, but Ive been met with *Im accepting classwork at anytime, even if late* and nothing else. Im not going to go off on incompetency of the teacher, that is a tirade for another day. My daughters dad is having her do work around the house during the day, when she should be doing schoolwork (feeding animals, cleaning, etc) How do I go about teaching her that she needs to be ""self-starting"" at his house and take her schoolwork into her own hands? Im a stay at home mom, currently, so my house is a 360° from her dads. Im always there to make sure shes doing what she needs to, helping her if she needs it, etc."
"A little while ago I posted about my 5 year old having this habit of just dumping her toys all over the floor and not actually playing with them. Since then my kids and I have done a complete overhaul and redo of the playroom. The kids picked 3 garbage bags of toys to donate when donation places open again and I did a quite minimalist look with toys on shelves. Well since then my youngest has not been dumping toys, she has actually been sitting there and playing with them. Sometimes she will take them on the floor or sometimes just play with them on the shelf (doesn't bother me either way, I'm just glad she's actually playing with them) it may not seem like much but I'm quite happy with our efforts. I think beforehand we had too many toys and she was just overwhelmed. It looks much better now. My kids did an awesome job helping too! Very happy momma here."
"My 1 year old is quite the handful! He is the youngest of 4 boys but he is by far the most mischievous. He is constantly climbing on the coffee table, chairs, couches, bedside table, the desk, and the dinning room table. He also takes things constantly like phones, controllers, and older kids schoolwork. We have tried telling him no, removing him/taking the item, and ignoring. Nothing has worked. Does anyone have suggestions of what we could do? He is making us all so frustrated!"
"Hi there, I was hoping you could help me.. my son is about to turn one in a couple weeks and my wife is ready to stop exclusively pumping. We have tried giving him soy milk and whole milk and both times he had a bad reaction (gassy,diarrhea,crying) Is there any other milk you could recommend us trying. Our pediatrician just doesn’t know..we feel like we’re against a wall."
"My daughter is 5 &amp; has a best friend in the neighborhood is 7. They play outside, sometimes for hours at a time. Usually it’s just riding bikes, doing gymnastics, regular kids things. Her friend is very polite and overall seems like a good kid, though she fights A LOT with her older sister, and she’s constantly nagging us to let our daughter to go outside. No big deal, she’s not my kid &amp; no means no when I say it so I don’t mind telling her “sorry, not right now” 10 times a day. The problem arises when my daughter comes inside. She cops a really bad attitude, starts talking back, often uses her whiny baby voice when things don’t go her way, and she gets pretty short tempered with her brother (who’s 2 1/2). I’m not really sure how to approach this. She has so much fun outside &amp; I know the fresh air and exercise is super good for her. We do plenty of family activities &amp; learning time early morning, at night, and during rainy days. I don’t want to take this privilege away from her because it just makes her so happy, but she acts like a totally different person when she comes inside. Any advice? 

Tldr; my 5 yo turns into a monster after playing outside with her friend."
"My son (5) missed out on his first teeball season. In December he had finally asked to play and I was over the moon. Since he got his first glove for Christmas we were playing catch inside every day and driving my wife crazy. Yes, there is now a slight dent in the wall.

We started with grounders, proper throwing motion, catching, and then batting. Every step of improvement is immediately followed by his big cheesy smile and my own sense of pride. When he learned his teeball season was canceled he stopped asking to practice as much but we've still kept it going especially on nice days. Today was a really nice day and we went into the back yard like we have many times before. He carried his bat and our gloves while I carried all the wiffle balls. The difference is today he asked to try hitting without the tee. I stood fairly close to make it easier for him and held about 10 balls in my glove while tossing. Normally when he hits with the tee I award him points for different things (1 for contact, 5 for good contact, 100 if he hits the tree). As we got started he was hacking at the ball so I started to correct him. He responds with ""I know, I know, I know"" before I could finish my sentence. He continues missing and just when I was going to offer for us to play catch he makes contact and the ball zooms by my head. This is when I made a mistake. 

""200 points if you hit me with the ball""

He responds with a devilish grin. I kid you not.. Three pitches in a row he sends line drives into me followed by his big belly laughs. On the last one I playfully fell to the ground and he erupted with laughter. My shin and side stung a little but boy I hope I remember this for the rest of my life. I'm sad that he lost his first season but I am so proud of him for trying to get better and I'm thankful that we get to keep making these memories."
Today I was trying to redo some flower beds for the wife for mother's day. My 3 yo was doing pretty good keeping herself occupied but I was 2 hours in and she was starting to not do so well. I told her to keep herself busy and play with some toys until I was done and she goes and sits on our steps and hangs her head and my heart breaks. I've hurt my daughter's feelings for the first time. So I tell her hey baby girl come here and she gets up and walks away from me and I stop her and say hey can you help me measure this? So we count the numbers on the tape measure and she draws the lines for the cuts and she seems happy to be helpful....but sitting here tonight 3 scotch's deep I am heartbroken. Feel like a shitty parent. Just venting.
"Any WFH tips/tricks/hacks for parents with a clingy baby? My daughter is 10 months and wants to be held and played with pretty much all the time. 

Any tips of encouraging independent play or ways to engage while working? Maybe put her in a back pack w head poking out? JK."
"My 4 year old son has been having dramatic outbursts when we try to discipline him. For example, tonight at our family relatives house, it was my son’s cousin’s turn to play with one of the toys he had and my husband had him hand it over. Tears well up in his eyes instantly, and he yells (at the top of his lungs) “go away!! Im going to be gone and go away FOREVER!! Im not going to play with ANYONE!” And he throws a big toy on the ground. I wanted to hide in a hole because brother in laws kids are so well behaved in comparison. 

We always try to reason with him or give him a hug, but he continues to yell (and test my patience). I always let him know that I understand his feelings but he usually doesnt calm down until something distracts him.

Time outs don’t work because its impossible to even get him to the time out area. He flops, yells NO, and hits. It seems like he cant handle being told what to do and follow any other rules other than his own. 

I dont know what to do anymore. My husband grew up with a abusive father and although he is against being aggressive/violent, he cant help but think that our son is mishaving because he doesnt fear us at all.

Im not sure what steps I need to take. I feel like im losing control of him (and soon his brother too once he starts learning his older brothers behavior). Any advice or books would be great"
"My 7-year-old has autism and ADHD. He is high functioning and takes vyvanse to help him out. He stopped wetting the bed years ago, relapsed for a few months last fall, and then stopped again. 

This past week, he has now wet the bed twice and yesterday alone, he peed his pants twice during the day. He told me that he was distracted and ignored the fact that he had to pee while awake yesterday. 

Any ideas on how we can better help him with this? Any ideas on what may be causing this? I’m wondering if the isolation due to the virus and/or the upcoming birth of his first younger sibling are messing with him. He has been acting out more lately and ignoring his dad and myself (which may just be his age and a defiant streak). His bio mother has been missing from his life since last July (she appears to be off living her best life), so the upcoming Mother’s Day is getting to him as well. Obviously we don’t speak ill of her, but we also don’t hide the fact that we genuinely don’t know where to send the card he made for her or have a way for him to call her."
"My kids have been getting the hand me down from hubby and I for years with cell phones but we arent upgrading anytime soon. My daughters phone is badly cracked and shocked her, needs to not be used lol. My son lost his... Looking as the prepaid plans, just go to the store and buy a card deal. I am only worried about internet usage. My daughter has bad anxiety at night and listens to calming YouTube videos to go to sleep. If anyone has experience with prepaid, I am asking your advice."
"This may sound super strange but at around 1 my son started to wake up screaming in the middle of the night and would walk around the room just screaming seemingly non responsive. Think something between a night terror and sleep walking. At around 2 when he was potty trained we realized that this would happen when he had to pee. So we would chase him around and try to guide him to the bathroom. Soon as he went pee he would stop screaming and sleep walk back to his bed and go straight back to sleep. He is now 8 and still does this. It's less of screaming now and more of a whimper. I don't have to chase him anymore generally... I just tell him to go to the bathroom. However, some nights he still runs around like a chicken with his head cut off seemingly unable to find the bathroom. If he's having trouble I get up as one night he did pee in the kitchen. He never remembers it in the morning. It's kind of hilarious kind of not when you are super tired. I tried to Google it and didn't really get any results other than there seems to be some correlation with night terrors and needing to use the washroom."
"Hi guys. I am currently writing this as I am so frustrated and I don't know where else to turn to. I need advice because I am losing my mind.  
My daughter was a perfect sleeper. She started sleeping through the night at six weeks old. As she grew older I would put her to bed with a bottle and she would sleep until morning. Perfectly. Which was really lucky as I have been a solo parent since she was a newborn. However, that all changed last June (when she was 2) when I took her with me to America (we are Australian) to visit my fiance. The flight was alright but she had a few extra bottles and then some bottles for jetlag to help sleep, car trips etc. It just ruined her whole routine. Ever since then she hasn't been the same.

When we got back it was worse. She would want 1-3 bottles to fall asleep and wake up for another one to two. I didn't want to give them to her but I live with my parents which I am thankful for but we are an inconvenience to them. They don't want to hear her cry or be woken up so they insisted on me constantly giving her the bottles. However, I managed to cut them out in March and it wasn't so bad. After a week she didn't want them at all.

Now I have a whole new problem. She won't go to sleep. I guess she was used to falling asleep on the bottle that now she doesn't at all. Her routine is dinner, bath, brush teeth, two books and then bed. She goes to bed at 7:30pm. However she doesn't fall asleep until around 9-10 every single night. She constantly calls me into her room and I have to go in because my parents will not let me teach her to self soothe and my daughter now knows I will come in. She calls me for anything. She just now called me in to cut her toe nails?? Usually it's to put her lullaby music back on, tuck her sheet back in or give her a drink as she refuses to keep the bottle in her bed. Otherwise cuddles, kisses or just to say goodnight. It drives me crazy as I am always exhausted and night time is my only break. I honestly don't know what to do.

She does have a nap during the day. It used to be as long as she wanted but I cut it down from 1-3 at the most. Two hours as that is what is recommended. She doesn't seem ready to cut the nap. She falls asleep easily and without calling out during the day. I don't really want to cut it unless I really need to.

So does anyone have any advice? I am desperate. How can I get my newly three year old daughter to stop calling out for two hours? Her sleep pattern right now is bed 7:30 and she will fall asleep around 9-10. Without fail she wakes up around 1am and then again around 4-5am and I often can't get her back to sleep. It's exhausting.

I need my good sleeper back. We are moving permanently to the US soon so I know jetlag might undo some of this but I still just need some ideas that can help. I am buying a Gro Clock to maybe try to help but if anyone has any other advice. I am pretty desperate.

tl;dr: 3 year old takes over two hours to fall asleep at night and constantly calls for me. Parents won't let me ignore her/tell her to settle. She then wakes up around 1am and 4am every night and is a struggle to get back to sleep. Advice?"
"Never used reddit before but i was told its a good place to get advice from ppl out in the world. 

So I've been dating my girlfriend for just about a yr. She has a four yr old son and they moved in with me about half a yr ago around Christmas, her son never had any form of discipline in his life. (aside the occasional ""dont do that"" and whether he kept doing it or not the family wouldn't care if he listened or not) so when he started living with me he was pretty out of control (imo), I explained to her before moving in that i had rules for my home and that ik he isn't my child and i wont try to act the dad route since it isnt my place (his dad is somewhat in the picture) but that the rules of my home will be followed. She agreed and so I was happy with them moving in, unfortunately i feel she didn't understand what i meant.

In the past 6 months the child has become more and more defiant, he refuses to listen to his mother, when i ask him who he has to listen to he says that he only has to listen to his grandmother (gf's aunt) and his 2 aunts (gf's cousins) as he spent his first 3 yrs living with them and his mother, problem is that my gf's aunt is the matriarch of their family and pushed anything my gf said to him aside and would make him listen to her (the ""grandmother"") which made him think that ""mom"" can be walked all over, talked down to, and be completely ignored. Sorry for the tangent, so when they moved in and i saw how unruly he was i sat her down and told her things need to change. I explained how I want her to teach him the meaning and power the title of mom is supposed to hold on a child. she agreed to do that and began putting him in timeouts, as that was the only form of punishment that made him listen (albeit for very brief period of time). it was so shocking to him in the beginning that when he went to visit his gma again after about a month he ran off, hid and cried when his mom said it was time to leave and come back. after that incident he has tried doing the same thing two more times. A few weeks ago his gma said something to my gf in front of him about having to spend some time with him while hes in bed and he took it as a command for his mom to sleep together with him and has ever since been crying, throwing tantrums, and refusing to go to sleep by his bedtime, typically will fall asleep 2 hrs later after being talked to multiple times and being put on TO subsequently. its been so consistent that ive pretty much had it already because I dont know where im supposed to step in, or stay on the side and watch it all unravel. i tried to talk to him and calm him down, explain that he needs to sleep alone, but lately ive been so sick of his behavior I just refuse to talk or play with him. 

I've had other relationships with women that had children before, always ended due to me not being able to handle watching from the side and let bad behavior fester, I don't really know what to do. I'm very unhappy with the situation and want it to change, but am completely lost in what I should do."
Our 10 month old has been sleeping 7-7 for several weeks now. A few weeks back she started waking up at 6:15-6:30 but ends up being tired and cranky ALL am. I suspect it’s because she’s waking up earlier than usual but I have no idea how to get her to keep sleeping. Any advice??
"I (40M) and my wife (37F) have a 4 year old daughter and a 3 month old son.  I’ve read so many posts about how your heart expands when another child is born and you’ll be amazed at how much more love you had to give than you thought possible, etc.  I do love my new son but it’s been three months now and the love I have for him is not even close to the love I have for my daughter.

She and I have always been super close, and she is the apple of my eye.  Every day she amuses and amazes me, and I cherish her so very much.  When she was born there wasn’t any sort of magical connection, but I did feel a desire to be very hands on and involved with her.  And over the years my love for her has grown so that I can’t imagine what life would be like without her.

I do love my son, but I’m not nearly as interested in holding him all the time as I was with my daughter, or snuggling him all day.  I am quite happy to have him around, help out as much as I need to, and spend just a few minutes of pure time with him each day.  I don’t know if it’s because his sister takes up so much of my attention, or if I’m just worn out this second go around.

Interestingly, my wife wasn’t ever that bonded with our daughter (though she loves her very much) and is much more bonded with our son.  I’m really happy to see her getting the same sort of baby love that I did with our daughter, we’ve always been sad that she didn’t get that.

Overall it feels like our family is in a good place, my wife and I are both happy with the distribution of labor and involvement with each child, both kids are happy.  And I hope that my love for him will explode one day and I will feel that bond, but I worry about what if it doesn’t...it might feel very sad to know deep down that I really prefer one child over the other.  Or maybe there’s a way I could accept that and still be a great father to each in different ways.

It feels unfair to compare a 4 year old to a baby because I’ve had 4 years to get to know my daughter.  And my son only started smiling two weeks ago. But I’ve heard so many things about not worrying before he was born because I would immediately love the second as much as the first.  I’ve not read a single thing about someone needing time to warm up to the second. 

Can anyone relate? It would help to hear other stories."
"So you have it drilled don't let your baby sleep on their stomach in birth classes because of all the dangers, but my little one has learned to roll on her stomach and I keep waking up to find her asleep on her stomach. Is 13 weeks a good time to stop being as strict on back sleeping or should I keep reinforcing back sleeping until she's a bit older?

 Developmental progress: She can hold her head up and even though she can, she does find it harder to roll back on her back than to roll on her stomach."
" Hi all! So, I have an incredibly bright 3 year old boy. I am a single parent and we live in an apartment. My son had shown me once or twice proudly that he’d pulled out a few hairs from his head, which I had thought he’d accidentally done but thought was neat or something. He has been exposed to an undue amount of stress due to his father’s behaviour (and my part of the trouble for not enforcing the boundaries to keep dad away).   
So, all had been going well with dad recently, but he had a big drama baloo last week, and I didn’t think the situation through to the end, and said dad could stay with us for 4 days. On day 3 dad started losing it, and I shut down the situation to get him out of there, but kiddo was still exposed to all that at home (including dad going on about being suicidal), and then the drive to drop dad off somewhere else, him yelling at his mom on the phone, etc, etc.   
Now, dad is all evened out again (for now), but, my son has shown me 2 or 3 more times that he’s pulled out his hair, and I thought he was rubbing at dirt in his eyes once, but he informed me he liked pulling his eyebrows/eyelashes. I also keep catching him trying to nibble on his finger nails now, after seeing his grandma do it.   
This, on top of the fact that I learned yesterday my son feels ‘very worried’ about the corona virus. I am very much doing my best, which clearly isn’t good enough given the circumstances surrounding our life.   
I really want to help him get control of this hair pulling now, and would love any advice for managing it. It says online that the sense of ‘pressure, followed by pleasure’ after pulling is a factor. I also read that in some cases fixing vitamin d issues worked as a fix for children. I have also read that it’s something to do with a lack of serotonin. And obviously, stress.   
Vitamin D shouldn’t be a problem now that it’s summer (as long as I’m visiting my mom, or his dad, who have yards). I am going to absolutely push more pork, beef and eggs, and was actually about to grab Spirulina for myself, so I’ll get some for him as well. We talk a lot about stress, the negative voice in our head, etc, but clearly I need an additional approach. I have also informed dad that we absolutely can not take him again in or around a time of crisis/stress.   
So - any advice from anyone else? Vitamins? Games? Books? Ways to talk about it? Do I jump to get a diagnosis for kiddo’s or court’s sake (We are also mid custody fight)? Techniques or toys or activities that offer kids that particular sense of control?   
TIA - I am not on Reddit often during the day so will be slow to respond"
"I kept telling myself it would go away, “as soon as he starts smiling”, “as soon as he starts babbling” “as soon as he starts crawling” I kept feeling like something would click and I would suddenly feel the undying motherly love everyone has and the guilt would stop, but it hasn’t. 

He turns 2 next month and I still don’t feel like he’s mine. Whenever people talk to him about his mum, I don’t think of myself. I love him and I care for him and I’m not neglecting him or his needs at ALL but I don’t love him as my son, I just love him because I have spent so much time caring for him. I never felt this way pregnant and I was so excited right up until the day he was born and it all suddenly felt so fake.

I tried talking to my SO about it and he told me to go to the doctor who prescribed my anti depressants. They didn’t really help and my SO ranted about how they’re pill pushers the entire time I was taking them and I felt too stupid to go back for more. 

The guilt is overwhelming at this point. I can’t let him cry about anything, or take 5 minutes to myself because I’m worried everyone will see right through me that I don’t love him like a nurturing mother and that makes me a terrible person. 

I don’t usually post looking for advice like this online hence the throwaway but I can’t talk to anyone in real life about this because the shame is so immense. I just feel worse and worse everyday."
"There's a 6 year old who likes to tease the living the shit out of my 4 year old, saying stuff like wanna be in my secret club? Nope, sorry, no girls allowed, and she falls for it and it kinda ruins her time at the local playground, just turns into him trying to get a rise out of her. She doesn't want to leave the playground, and I try and redirect her and deflect when the 6 year old tries to get me to explain to my daughter what he means when he says he doesn't want to see her for a year (she'll ask, ""how long is a year?). 

My instincts tell me to teach her to either ignore him, or double down, like ""Cool, I don't want to see you for two years!"" What I did do was ask her if she wanted to show him how to build a lightsaber, which she did (we're good friends with the parents, he comes by all the time, and during this covid thing, he's the only kid she hangs with). 

It's not a huge deal, I just want to make sure I'm not making any big mistakes. I haven't talked to her directly about it because I didn't want to problematize her only friendship at the moment. Thanks for any advice or direction on what to read."
"I understand the urge to control what factors are influencing our child, but this one I think it's a little silly.

I'm not interested in introducing anyone to my child unless it's a serious relationship anyway, so by the time I've determined this is a person I can really see myself being with long-term, what if my ex doesn't like him? I'm not going to stop seeing that person, so it'll all just be pointless and awkward I think.

Anybody else have any input? I'm open to changing my mind about the whole thing, but I currently just don't see the point."
"My brother creeps me out when he is around my son. I have made it clear to my mom that he can't be around my son unsupervised.  She doesn't like it but says whatever.  She thinks Im being over-protective. I don't like how he gives him ""back rubs"" and weird caresses. My brother and I aren't close but he loves being an uncle I guess. Thing is when I am working sometimes and my son is at my moms (cant really afford daycare rn) my brother will zip over there to see him. I always hear about it after the fact, they tell me sheepishly because they know they went around my back. My question is can I get a restraining order against my brother to keep him away from my kid when I'm not around?                          EDIT: thank you for all the support and comments, other  arrangements have been made for my boy to stay w/ his mom's mom while I'm at work this weekend and gor the foreseeable future until we can get this all squared away."
We had the awesome idea of call the fire station and asked them if they would come to our house for my sons birthday and they said yes ! We had some balloons and a cooler with popsicles for the kids. A lot of people came to say happy birthday to my son ! So at 4 pm the firefighters came ! My son was so happy !
"He's 2 year 10 month old and he is going to preschool and when i see other at his age talking, making sentences, communicating with their parents it makes me sad. 

I know that each child develops at her or his own pace but still... 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to bring him to a speech therapist. i had an appointment 2 months ago but with the lock-down he'll only start next week.

This school year with the corona virus is fucked up so he'll start school in September and i hope that he'll be able to communicate with his friends and teacher! That's the most important i want my son to have friends and play with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

How many sessions did you saw progress with your child?"
"Currently typing under covers in my son's bed... Here's how it happened

He's started having nightmares, last night he was inconsolable unless he was in our bed, which already has our 18 month old daughter in it (still doesn't sleep through) most of the time. Needless to say with 4 in a bed it was not a good night sleep for anyone.

Tonight managed to persuade him back into his own room (which has a scary bear in it, obviously). He's currently in his sister's cotbed (his old bed) and I'm in his bed. He seems settled and content. Hopefully we will all sleep.

Question is- have I just set myself up for more issues? Had a precedent been set? I mean it's better than last night, but it's not ideal. 

Any other tips on toddler nightmares?"
"My 6 year old is autistic and doesn't have many friends, she plays Roblox a lot and gets upset when she plays Adopt Me and can't find a family. She gets sad when she dies in a game. 

I made an account of my own in Roblox to play with her. My favorite game to play with her is Fashion Famous. She sometimes will copy my character and then we hit the runway and people are mean in their comments because she copied me. (She doesn't have the chat feature turned on so she can't see what they say.) I get sad for her when people are mean in their comments but don't really know the whole story.

Next time you play Roblox and see someone asking for a family in adopt me, adopt her so she can know how good the gaming community really is...."
"Which pc games are you playing with kids ( 5,yr ). Where did you get them from? I am finding it surprisingly difficult to come across decent things...

I dont have have Console.

Lockdown in Mumbai is pretty strict so no playground.

Thank you"
"Background: in my country the kids (3 yr and 11 month boys) have been home now 51 days. In the beginning it was really hard but we got into a solid routine. Every day we wish school will come back but not yet...
My wife works in special ed and they are bringing that back sooner than the regular school system. It's only twice a week for 7 hours each day. I want to preface this by saying I have no problem with being with both kids all day long. In fact, I think we do better bc I'm kind of the strict one and they both know it so there are less tantrums. We have lots of fun and the routine still works. But the thought of being on my own with them all day long is giving me so much anxiety. 
Now, when we need it, there are times where one us can take a breather. If it's just me I'll have to just suck it up. I'm nervous but I also don't want my wife to not go to work as it's good for the country, herself, and the kids she treats. We've spoken and she knows how I feel and we both know in the end I'll be fine. I just feel that it's going to be a looooong day and I hope I can make it. 
Anyway, just needed to vent. 
Ps. Before the virus I was never on Reddit and I have found this has been a very safe and productive place to share things."
"Quick summary as to how I became a 24/7 parent to my little sister is quite a sad one (please keep your thoughts and opinions about this to yourself). My parents were deported after being in the US for 20 years and are now seeking asylum. I have been a parent to my sister for 8 months back in 2018, and now, she is with me once again. She’s been with me since I had to pick her up from CPS after my parents turned themselves in on Feb 2020. 

For the first few weeks, it was all good! She would obey me (I live with my boyfriends family) and obey  the people I live with. She would ask for things nicely, she did not give me an attitude, etc. She would behave and it would be all fine...up until a couple of weeks ago. 

My sister now demands things from me from time to time. For example, if we go to the store, she’ll say “you have to buy me this” or “I will have this”. I, of course, sometimes buy it, but I mostly don’t (she’s already gone through so much as a child, I want her to know that I’m here for her).  Or when she’s hungry, “make me food now”. 
She’s also been quite rude. If I’m talking to my boyfriend, she will get mad, make a rude remark like “I don’t like you”, slam the door and go to her room.  She also does thing thing after she gets mad, she’ll say “you don’t like me” or “why do you hate me so much”. 

One more thing she does which bothers people in the house I’m living with, she walks around the house in the middle of the night. Either to get food, get up and try to find her electronics, etc. 
I take away the iPad and Nintendo switch at 10:30pm. After that, no electronics. Straight to bed. She gives me an attitude and then starts crying about how she misses her parents and how she wishes she wasn’t living in this house anymore. 

I’m already struggling mentally and emotionally with everything going on with my parents, it’s hard to keep up with trying to discipline her. I mean, it’s hard because I still see her as a sister, but it hasn’t gone through my head that I am now her legal guardian. Her parent. 

Before all this happened, I was very dependent on my parents (I was 18). Then all of a sudden, I was a parent. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve put her in time out, taken away her toys, her electronics, have given her bedtimes from 9pm or 10pm, extended her timeout and the “no electronics” until the next day.

Please help me out before I rip my hair out and have more mental breakdowns. 

Thanks in advance :)"
"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

My dear little one is turning 6 weeks soon, and whilst he is sleeping quite well at night (from 10pm to 9am, waking up every 2 hours for feeds) he just doesn't want to sleep during the day. He is quite alert and happy (although doesn't smile yet!) in the morning but from 2pm to 9pm it's usually a lot of crying between breastfeeding and micro naps of 10 to 20 minutes. The crying is very intense with Pain like face. I'm wondering if it's just the ""colic"" phase or if there's something wrong? He is also becoming quite fussy at the boob so we had to supplement with formula which helps a bit with sleeping.

&amp;#x200B;

We just can't get him to sleep more than that. We've tried swaddling, white noise, baby carriers, everything... he is just very fussy during the day. It's taking a big toll on us as we can't get anything done at all during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone with the same experience?"
"Title pretty much say it all. My 10month old is now starting to crawl! Yeah! Now, we need to double babyproof everything. That means finding a baby gate for the stairs. It's a new house and we didn't have stairs in the old one.

I'm trying to find a baby gate that is safe for 10months BUT that 3yo and 6yo will be able to open."
"Well, the title pretty much sums up what happened in my home this morning! My beautiful miracle rainbow baby dived off the couch and onto the floor....I saw it happen out of the corner of my eye and was unable to stop it. 

Before you ask - he shows no sign of concussion or trauma other than a slight goose-egg on his forehead. (The couch is very low to the ground)  But man, I feel like a sh*t parent. I know this has happened to thousands of babies before mine and will continue to happen...but mom guilt is so flipping real. And away from the actual fall, as a parent you wonder if ""oh gosh. Is he acting normal?"" ""Should I take him to the hospital?"" and you keep checking him constantly for marks and bruises...and then you wonder if you're making the right decision!?. 

Y'all. Parenting is hard. I need a drink."
"Parent of twins boy and a girl about 3.5 years old. Son hates sleeping daughter likes sleeping. Son goes down easiest if we driving in the car but if at home in bed he’ll fight it a lot. 

I feel we have a good nap and bedtime routine. It’s calming, quiet, we read stories, get in bed, tuck them in but he always tries to fight it off and ends up crying himself to sleep. I’m left wondering if I’m doing anything wrong... I really need help because I want him to like going to sleep. 

I’ve read The happiest baby in the block and the happiest toddler as well. I’m just not sure there’s enough for me to takeaway from them to help me out. 

Questions...
Routine and Schedule - How important is it to stick to them, should breakfast, lunch and dinner always be at the same time every day? If you’re one that’s not good with sticking to schedules, will this be problematic?

Sleep Hours - We’re striving for at least 12 hours per day, does it matter when they happen? For example if they go to bed later in the evening they should wake up later in the morning. Similarly nap will happen later as well. At first thought we want them in bed sleeping by 7:30pm but if the fell a sleep at 9pm, does this make any difference?

Any advice or strategies would be helpful..."
"So my 1 yo (12 months) still has about 3 bottles of milk a day and 3 meals.
Yet she seems to almost daily vomit a little of the milk up.

Do you think this could be because she’s bloated?

I usually space out the milk and meal by at least a few hours and I never pressure her to eat or drink more.
So I’m not sure"
"Wanting to hear experiences on traveling with young kids &lt;5 please! How did you find air travel? Accommodation choices? What did your kids eat if they’re picky? Getting around? Sightseeing etc? Did you wish you’d just stayed home?

We have a just turned 3y old and a 21mth old. We haven’t travelled anywhere with them yet as it just wasn’t something hubby and I wanted to do with babies as we’re not huge travelers anyway.

After covid, we’re keen to get traveling with them since they both walk, talk, eat food and only 1 naps once a day, and we’re close to having our youngest out of nappies! 

We’re thinking Domestic first in next 12 months (we’re in Australia) then going Intn’l nearby the following year to Fiji, Japan, Dubai etc and leaving longer trips like the US for when they’re 8/9 yrs and can ride some Disneyland rides. 

So - something else that’s been on mind is that I think I want a third baby. Hubby and I are both on the fence about it. We’ve gone back and forth all year on this. We feel like we’ve just gotten out of the baby baby stage and we can finally do things easier after having two babies only 17mths apart. Given we’ve never even actually travelled with a baby or toddler, I wanted to hear others experience about how difficult it is traveling with kids &lt;5. Will adding a younger baby make it that much more difficult than just the older two toddlers? Am I making it a bigger thing than it is?!

We’re obviously not basing our entire decision to have baby 3 on whether we can travel, but I’m interested to hear experiences on traveling with young kids in general. Inability to travel is one of the top things on my “cons” list for baby 3 - maybe some baby traveling experts can convince me it’s not all doom and gloom to travel with young kids!"
"My daughter is 3yo and the youngest of my three kids. She is by far the worst and most clingy sleeper. 

Don’t get me wrong,  none of my kids have been great sleepers as young toddlers and babies but by this point my other kids has figured out sleeping at least SOME. 

Actually with my boys they went down pretty easily and after the stopped nursing at night they only woke once and crawled in my bed during the wee hours of the morning.

My daughter wakes up several times a night. She is SO hard to settled and actually get to sleep. Her bedtime routine takes HOURS. And sometimes it still doesn’t work. 

Tonight it took over 4 hours, 5 books, 4 potty trips, lots of screaming and crying and 5mg of melatonin. It was still after midnight before she fell asleep. 

And it’s not just that she won’t go to sleep. She wants me to lay with her while she suffocates me. She rolls all over me. She tangles her hands in my hair. She kicks the covers off but then demands them again. She wants the fan off and then on again.

We’ve tried a sound machine. Sleep music. Hypnosis sleep stories. 
EVERYTHING. 

She drives me freakin nuts. 

Tonight I had to walk away out of pure frustration. She cried and screamed. I tried to calm her down and walked away again. She screamed more. Finally she settled and fell asleep without being on top of me, but I’m pretty sure she thought me laying beside her was better than me leaving completely. 

She eats a good diets and gets plenty of outside time. 

We’ve tried starting bedtime earlier and later. 
Nothing works. 

If she doesn’t nap she will go to bed earlier but it still takes forever. 

If she does nap it’s usually super late and more of a pain to get her to bed at night. 

Really though without a nap she can’t make it past 5pm. And then we risk her taking a nap between 5-7pm and then we are really screwed. 

I’m just so tired. And I’m so touched out and frustrated. And it’s been like this for YEARS."
"Does anyone else struggle with finding/making adult friendships post becoming a parent? Our little is 21months old and I’m definitely starting to feel like I have missed the how to make new friends bus.

I had some friends I lost right after she was born(probably weren’t meant to be long term right?) and my best friend lives over an hour away on a busy farm. My husband and I don’t have any couple friends close and I think we are both missing that connection.

Any tips on building new friendships after kids? Is there an app for mom friends 😅?"
"I had my daughter ten months ago. Traumatic birth followed by the WORST PPD ever for months. I remember the thoughts of wanting her to die or wishing I could undo it. I remember when she would cry I would leave the room because it made me ill. I hated life. I tried meds, therapy even had to go to the ER two weeks in because of a major panic attack. I did not think I would survive. Then at 6 months I changed therapists, decided to try a new antidepressant and get through the HUMP of awfulness and started birth control. By 8 months I felt my depression from before the baby was also better (I had depression issues before baby). I’m glad I stuck through the medicine hump and got to the other side. Things are so different. The quarantine hasn’t helped but I love being her mom. I’ve always been a nurturer being the eldest of two younger siblings and that has finally come through. I used to dread her waking up and wished she wouldn’t. Now I can’t wait to see her in morning. I’ve accepted I may not sleep in past 630-7 for AWHILE and frankly that’s ok. Sleeping in always gave me headaches and I no longer have those. It’s not 100% perfect but the shift has been visible to everyone around me. 

I also feel intense guilt for not enjoying her baby phase more. For not cuddling her more or enjoying her sleeping on me as a newborn. I know we likely won’t have a second given the experience with the first but I feel intense guilt and I also get sad she’s almost not a baby anymore.

For moms with PPD, I was really really really bad. But with the right help and time things turned around and they can for others too!"
"I want my kids to go to a good school, like everyone else. But what does a good school mean? I went to a highly rated high school in the suburbs and I hated it. If you weren't rich and popular you were nothing. Teachers were rude, picked favorites, I was bullied etc. 

My husband went to a low rated diverse school in the middle of the city and had the opposite experience. 

I also see that small rural schools get low ratings. Why? I feel like my kid would be happy in a smallish school instead of being just a number.  

Are schools just rated by test scores? I'm so confused. I would rather my kid be happy than have high test scores."
"I am a father and today I spanked my daughter under 5 year for the first time and it hurt me too that almost burst into tear. I had an ideal that I will never raise my hand toward my daughter at least until  she is old enough to comprehend the situation.   
It was her nap time but she got into hyperactive mode and started to jump and throw cushion all over. Its no the first time and last time I tried distracting her by showing her cartoon that she likes. However, today I felt that I was actually spoiling her so I raised my voice as warning but she just laugh it so I spanked once which still reacted as if I was joking until I grab her to spank her several time until she realized that I was serious and started to obey.  I could see she was shocked and distressed.    
I am shocked myself and want to ask if I gone too far too fast or if I did the right thing to raise my child."
"She has requests all days. I just like a slave. I love her, but I have been with her for 40+ days. I would like some suggestions of how to make her play alone."
"Our 4 year old son is jumping on us, licking me, and is generally all over me (f38) all the time. He won't listen when we ask him to stop and his craziness usually ends in tears. It's not a new behavior but it hasn't gotten better. I try to be affectionate as much as is reasonable but sometimes I need some space and he doesn't care. Sorry this is short but he's in time out and I need to address this with him."
"Hi to all you awesome parents, this is my first time posting! 

I am (F41) have an amazing child (F3). 

So tonight I was making dinnner, and put on Trolls for her to occupy her while I cooked. She has watched this a few times so it was known to her (this is relevant). 

The movie gets to the point where Branch is recollecting why he doesn't sing (his grandma dies)...and I hear my daughter just burst into tears, she is inconsolable!!! Well, I stop what I'm doing and ask her what's up? She tells me ""baby branch lost his grandma!!!!"" For the next while she is just so sad and crying. I do my best to explain, not shirking from the facts to much, she cries and then gets over it eventually. 

So my question is...how do you explain death to a 3 year old?! 

I was not expecting this kind of gravity at such a young age."
"How is it that some people absolutely love being a mom like I see them &amp; they love it they thrive and it's like their calling or some shit. They just love being a mom being a parent being with their kids. And here I am like I hate this shit dont get me wrong I love them I have moments where I love it but if I'm being honest I mainly dont like it I hate it. People say I'm garbage because I say ""if I could go back in time I wouldn't have been mom at all ever."" I now know that no I'm not maternal I use to think I cant wait to be a mom because honestly my childhood sucked badly like lifetime movie bad and I know now that i wanted to be a mom to fill this gap to make right what I didnt have or do I guess because now I'm in it and it sucks. Yet they are the best thing to happen in my shitty life &amp; made me grow up but also made reflect on my real feelings and self kinda"
"We're at our wits end. Our 2.5 year old suddenly refuses to sleep alone and/or in her room. 

This has never been an issue before, our routines worked quite well since she started sleeping alone at 1.5 years.
But since March she either can't seem to fall asleep or is afraid of ""being alone"" in her room. No amount of hand holding, night light or assuring that we're just in the next room seem to work very well. We tried letting her cry, but she seems genuinely scared and it just makes everything worse. 

She doesn't want/can't say what's wrong, we assume there were some nightmares from what she's telling. Yesterday she said she didn't like her room anymore... half her things are there, she likes playing there and at naptime she's out like a light in 2 minutes? It's just the nights.
We cut back naptime to 1 hour, but she's extremely tired around noon so we think she might still need that. It doesn't seem to matter when we put her to bed, she needs at least an hour to doze off, be it 7, 8 or even 9 or 10pm, crying again at 2 or 3am. Then it's another hour until she can sleep. She really tries most days, but just can't calm down. Most nights she ends up in our bed, it seems to be easier for her there. As I said, she was perfectly able to do this before but somehow unlearned it?

I wouldn't mind so much but we're expecting our second child and I don't think it will get easier, space will be even more of an issue in our bed. 

As far as we are aware there were no big changes recently that might explain the reaction. Well, apart from corona and closed daycare...

Any idea what might help?"
"My son is 7 and has been taking baths by himself for at least a year. He used to love taking baths. Now he's at the point where he doesn't like taking them. The problem is it sometimes seems like he's not bathing well, but he's also getting to the age where he doesn't want us to see him naked. I guess I'm looking for advise for how to males sure a 7 year old is bathing properly while also respecting his privacy."
"My teen has been attending a great school since 6th grade and is getting close to graduation.  Like many schools during this coronavirus time, her school closed their doors and the students are learning online.  

Without the structure and interaction of class, schoolwork has really suffered.  Assignments are lackluster or are turned in late despite check-ins with us.  Even the classes that my teen loved are suffering.

I’m at whits end on what to do next. It’s less than a month to graduation.  I’ve reached out to the instructors for their thoughts, but any advise would be appreciated."
"My SO and I are super sad right now because his 4 year old seemed really down tonight, mentioning his mom telling him I’m a stranger and he needs to stay away from me.

Previously he has also mentioned to us that mom says I’m a “dumb woman”.

We do not speak ill of his mom at our place at all.  For history I have been in his life since he was 2 and helped take care of him a lot.

I just feel awful because he got really quiet/sad and when I asked him if he thought I was a stranger he said no, that he told his mom he knows me and knows my name.  I gave him a hug and told him that is what matters, and that I care about him a lot.  Now I’m up wondering if I did anything wrong, or if I said the right thing.

Any advice on how to handle this if it comes up again?  Should I try not to be as close to him so he doesn’t get confused on how to treat me? :("
"My sone is 2 (3 in june) and he fuels my anxiety like nothing else.
I'm 7 months pregnant with what will be my second child and I feel like I do nothing but scream at him. I always feel bad afterwards and he seems like he's just getting use to it and its breaking my heart.
He's constantly doing something destructive or is just telling me no to EVERYTHING. I hate to admit it but he has been spanked by me quite a bit... today he decided he was going to start jumping down my very slick wooden stair with his socks on which just instantly trigger me to scream at him very loudly and he ran off bawling.
I just don't know what to do. I don't wanna be an asshole to him but I just feel helpless in my situation."
We've talked to her. Punished her. Sent her to a therapist which she sees every week. Bought multiple locks for her window which she breaks. And she just keeps sneaking out. It's causing so much stress in our family and I don't know what to do with her. We are in VA
We've got cake and a couple presents for a 10 year old turning 11 but that's all. I have no idea what to do to make the day special at home with such limited resources. What are ways you guys have been celebrating?
"So first off,  I'm a stay at home dad.  We already have a child(baby girl) that just turned 2.  Jan 31 of this year we had baby #2.  Little boy.  Since my wife was already going on maternity leave,  this covid stuff didn't really bother us too much as we were basically self locked in already, and had planned ahead of time for not leaving the house.

However,  My wife's leave is up in two weeks,  leaving me with a 2 year old toddler (aka: satan)  and a 4 month old little boy who wont take a bottle of any kind.  He's completely breast fed. 

A slightly positive note, my wife will be working from home when she returns.  99% of her company has gone WFH.   We're lucky enough to have a 3rd floor office that can get her away during the day.   So if emergencies come up she can help.   But we are going to try it like she's not home.  Only coming down for lunch and dinner. 

That leavea me alone,  locked in the house with two kids.  One that needs constant exercise or she goes crazy,  and a baby that's fussier than Trump at a Senate Hearing. 


I dont know what Im going to do."
"LO is 1y5m, and will typically wake up once a night and come sleep with DH and me, that's just what works for us. Tonight, she woke up and wouldn't calm down, she started screaming whenever we tried to lay down. Eventually we brought her downstairs where she drank 10 oz from her sippy cup and wanted more. 

She is currently laying on top of me with a death grip on her refilled cup, falling asleep. This has never happened before, what should we do? It's she ok?"
"I’ve posted about this before, but it just bothers me and I wish he would quit. He’s been doing this for about 6 weeks. He bangs his head on things or smacks himself on the forehead. He does this all the time (at least 20 times today). Sometimes it’s because he’s frustrated because he is told no, I take something away, etc. Other times it’s just because and he’ll even laugh. 

I’ve ignored it, I’ve said no, etc. 

It just breaks my heart and I feel like I’m failing because I can’t get him to stop. Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks so much."
"My SO for some reason refuses to think outside the box when it comes to our almost 4 year old.

When it comes to him putting her to sleep, instead of redirecting when she doesn't want to lay down, and is having a tantrum, he decides it is better to just yell and argue with her. Since we take turns putting her to bed, I end up there most of the time because she wants me, cause of all the yelling.

When I put her to bed, if she tries to pull anything I am able to redirect her tantrum and get her to lay down.

For day to day stuff it is the same way. He just wants her to do what he says, and i get that, me too. I just think sometimes redirecting her to change her mood and to get her to listen is the better approach, because it actually works for her.

He doesn't like to be told that he could be doing anything differently then his current approach, and gets defensive. I am just like, but is it working? Does it really change what is happening.

His new deal is taking her out of bed and putting her in time out if she doesnt listen, which creates more crying. She hasn't napped in 2 months due to being home 24/7 so she is extra tired at night and is more resistant to bedtime.

How do you get your SO to see that what they are doing isn't working, and that they should do it differently without hurting feelings?"
"So start off, i am an expecting first time mom and quite excited. Me and my husband have been reminiscing on our upbringings and discussing how we would have dealt with our young selves often lately. Both of our youths had their fair shares of highs and lows, however my teenage lows have left me with relatively severe and certainly very noticeable self harm scars on the majority of my extremities. While i dont notice them almost at all anymore and have moved past those struggles, he has reminded me that they are indeed pretty jarring to most people.
 The question has been raised as to how and when we should discuss this with our child. They would be impossible to hide and while it seems inevitable, im so hesitant to raise any awareness to them as i think there is a good chance i never wouldve thought to start hurting myself had someone else not introduced the idea to me at an impressionable and young age.  As a very young child, id imagine itd be easy to tell quick fibs about having extreme stretch marks or something. However, a teenager will certainly recognize them as deliberate cuts.. they are very uniform and all of similar length, in rows up and down my legs and arms. 
Would trying to continuously lie be wrong? 
How would we even go about talking about something like that without imprinting it as an idea?
At what age would that be reasonable?
For the first time in my life, this actually feels like its affecting someone besides me and i feel horrible. God forbid they ever self harmed, how could that not be entirely my fault?
Any tips, thoughts, or advice appreciated"
"I am somewhat concerned because my 15 year old just told me at 8am she has not been to bed yet.

She stayed up all night fighting with a guy on the phone and posting mean comments on his social media (more concerning).

I don't have much to punish her for as her grades have actually improved and she does all the chores she is supposed to do around the house. However, she has dark circles under her eyes and will sleep most of the day today.

Any input appreciated. Thanks."
"Just go straight to TLDR. Come back here if you need more bg info.

My son is 4½. He was diagnosed with autism; developmental and speech delay, and feeding issues a few months before he turned 2 (because I insisted he new tested for autism &amp; even made the appts for all of his issues). Very recently, he's been whining, screaming to the top of his lungs, and throwing/breaking things. His dad &amp; I are separated but his dad is truly making a d$#k moves, truly evil when you really think about it, to have this kind of hate or spite is just cruel for the collateral damage. We've already gone thru the court custody battle and we were done a year ago. He's already taking me back to court because he's asking for full custody, lying, I can back up every lie he's told, I mean Pre-Trial, the judge told him he wouldn't be changing anything if there wasn't anything significant. The lie first started with the salt, but the story grew and grew every court visit because the judge kept saying saying the same thing, oversleeping and having your kid pour salt everywhere 🤣. This was his house after our breakup so it's not as child proof as mine is because I'm extra when it comes to his safety. Our son had (until recently) daily ABA after Pre-K. I don't know what's going on at his dad's and my issue is that he never trusted me (an RN). I have 3 adult children who grew up in a real family home, never any atypical issues. He legit lost his kids in the woods TWICE because he has a gaming addiction. And I'm a gamer. A real gamer, we played in many co-op, MMO games together. He had over 100 HOURS in a 2 WEEK period. His kids are also almost adults now too and they hate him, they told me to my face. He winded up giving up his parents rights. And the opposite for me. He didn't want to parent our son at first either but after his arrest for assault and battery, DCF entered into our lives, he was mandated to take a 42 week long battery course (I found out after that this was not his 1st A&amp;B). So I sometimes worry about our speechless son. But we've also had 2 years of mandated reporters either in our homes or in their offices. We got back together after the Trial for a bit but it wasn't working out for either of us &amp; because I hate confrontation, I left without saying a word. It's just that the 1st time we have sex, he talks like we've made a commitment to each other and I was a douche for not correcting that (i really liked the sex).  Mandated Reporters. Every Week Day. I was recently told that I'm a ""great mom."" And, You're Super Mom."" He needs for nothing at both homes. I'm the more affectionate one but his dad is smart, knows some of the oddest things but smart. So here's either evil 6 petty. 

TLDR: 4 yr old boy with autism, in 2 different homes, just recently started screaming at the top of his lungs, refusing to listen and it just seems like he wants to fight me on everything.... and I mean every single thing. I have a helpful flip book with feelings and choices to feel better (also helps him use his words). He was great at it before but until we had to cut his ABA recently &amp; no school, he's out of control and I am doing my best for him but it's hard. How can I help our son? What besides #socialdistancing could be causing these new behaviors? What should I be doing? Also when he's not watching smoke detectors and fire alarms on YouTube, he's making the sound of an alarm and this is on the main TV for the past 2 weeks or so. Alarms, that's what I hear when we're home and he's not in the mood for. It's driving me nuts. I use one earbud and do my mommy things so I can still hear him and not cut off my ears. 😭 I do spoil him but I also discipline him the way the ABA providers taught me. Every mess he makes, he has to clean up. And we do play together every time he asks. 1: because he's using his words; 2: because I love him and love being his mom"
"First time parent here everyone and as wonderful and rewarding as it is it sure comes with its challenges. So, getting to the point our 3mo is quite the needy little guy and will not sleep in a bassinet or alone EVER. I spend most of my nights watching my wife hold him bc he will only sleep at night after breastfeeding and even that doesn't always work. Recently though we are thinking he's starting his first sleep regression (or maybe teething) and from about 10pm to 1-2am we struggle to get him to rest which then results in him (and us) getting overtired making the whole situation even harder. We're trying to stay positive and keep an open mind bc we're all new at this so there's going to be tough times but basically I am wondering if anyone can offer some advice on how to alter your baby's sleep schedule to something a bit more manageable for everyone. As of right now our boy will fall asleep very late and then sleep in all morning (he's definitely not a morning person). So, what are some schedules for naps and routines that work for you? We already are trying to build a routine of pj's and book time to get him into the mood but it only works when he's in a super good mood or had a nice easy day, any stray from the normal and everything goes out the window. Baths also sometimes help calm him down but that's also after he's been up for 3-4+ hours. During the day his naps will sometimes only last 30 min so just sleep in general for us needs a bit of improvement. Any help or ideas will be greatly appreciated and good luck to anyone else out there trying to manage a totally new lifestyle during the pandemic. Fun, fun, fun!"
"My son is 6 months as of this week. He’s a happy boy mostly, thriving and meeting all his milestones but he is very high needs.

He has had colic and slept and fed awfully from the outset which made the newborn period incredibly challenging. The colic has resolved but he continues to have significant reflux which he’s on special formula for (medicines didn’t work for long). So the past few months he has been super fussy with each bottle. My paediatrician gave it a name of bottle aversion secondary to severe reflux. 

So as a result of the colic and poor sleeping, we used to rock and bounce the kiddo to sleep and often fed him to sleep. 
Now because of the reflux we gently bounce, as often that’s the only way he will feed and/or sleep. Most days he doesn’t need as much rocking or bouncing during the day for feeds or naps but the last nap and bedtime are always a struggle. 
After these efforts thankfully he manages to drink a good normal amount of milk that he’s supposed to for his age/weight. 

In terms of sleep - my kiddo wakes up 2-2.5 hourly. Most times he will feed an ounce or two and then go back to sleep. Without a feed, he will not settle, cry hysterically and be awake for hours. 

Multiple conversations with people lately has resulted in me being told that I’m crazy to still rock/bounce at 6 months and  I’ve ruined/spoiled my baby as a result. That sleeping to feed will cause long term behavioural/sleep issues. That I need to re-evaluate my parenting because I respond to the crying too soon, attend to him too quickly and co-sleep and that Ive created a high needs baby by accommodating for the fussiness. That I should let him fuss and/or starve for each feed so he can learn to get over it all on his own. 
And also that I could fix the feeding/reflux and sleep issues if I sucked it up and decided to sleep train (which currently I do not want to do so please do not recommend this as a solution).

I’m exhausted from the sleeplessness and parenting more or less solo. I’m overwhelmed by trying to be the perfect parent. And now I feel ashamed/guilty for failing at the latter. 

I mean, to be fair to people - is it normal for a formula fed 6 month old to be waking 2-3 hourly still? Everywhere says he should be sleeping longer stretches, through the night even? 
My son had his 6 month checkup and he’s doing swimmingly so *I* must be doing something wrong? Have I ruined/spoiled him with the bouncing and attending to him?

Just looking for some reassurance and guidance and personal stories (again!).

TIA.

ETA: clarify details."
"Being isolated with family and a child is exhausting and overwhelming. I find myself always seeking to escape. Not forever, just 15 minutes. I miss alone time. I miss quietness and calmness. 

Is everyone doing okay during these crucial times with the pandemic and their mental health?"
"My step son has never really had friends.  Just when he started making some at school this awful pandemic hit and he's lost all of the connections he was making.  He doesn't have a way to contact the few friends he had started to make at school because we weren't able to get any phone numbers before school abruptly ended for the year.

He was playing with a few other boys in his class every recess and things were looking up.  Now though he is just alone all the time.  With no way to get his energy out he is extremely hyper and very clingy with us.  I wish that I could help him in some way.

In every way he seems like a very typical little boy.  I'm not sure where the struggle has come from him making friends other than that he can be shy around strangers.

Is there any way I can help support him making connections?  Do you think we will have to wait for school to start up again before this is possible?"
"I have a super light sleeper (10m). From the beginning I put him to sleep in his own room with dark blinds and white noise. We have an awesome but loud 3 yr and it was an issue with sleeping in the beginning. He would constantly wake up. Since I put him in the room no issues. He puts himself to sleep and sleeps most of the night, with the exception of one night feeding. Normally I go to sleep after the kids are down for the night since I’m exhausted. Normally their father works night shift. With hubbs home more recently I’ve noticed that the 10m old is very sensitive to noise. Even with the white noise machine on. How do I get him used to sleeping even with background noise? I feel like I’m setting him up for failure down the road with the noise sensitivity."
"Hey guys! I have a 5yo and 9yo daughter. With all this COVID-19 stuff going on (and me being an essential worker and still working) my mom has been helping me during the weekdays watching my kids. She has them most of the day throughout the week and every once in awhile keeps them a night or two during the week if I work late, but they are always with me for the weekends which I have off. At my moms house their room is up a flight of about 10-12 stairs, and in my apartment our bedrooms are also up a flight of about 10 stairs. They’ve never been an issue before (we’ve lived here since July 2019) and even in our old house prior there were two flights of stairs to get up to the main living area. Also never a problem! About a month and a half ago my 5yo seemed to suddenly develop a fear of all the stairs. She always wants somebody to help her down (all the stair cases have hand rails), and if anybody else is going up or down at the same time she always insists on going last. I asked my mom if she wiped out on the stairs at her place one day or something, but she hasn’t. Several months ago (probably around Thanksgiving?) she did miss the bottom stair once and hit her butt pretty hard, but even after that it was never an issue until recently. I just don’t understand what the sudden problem is!? 
My mom has asked her several times why she is scared of the stairs and all she says is “I don’t know.” I’ve asked her the same thing with the same response, but Friday night she did tell me she was “scared of falling down the stairs”. I asked why, and she just shrugged. I asked if she had fallen down the stairs before, and she said no, but it just seems to be getting worse. A few minutes ago I was cleaning the living room and heard her hemming and hawing upstairs and asked if she was okay, and she said “I just can’t go down the stairs!” And I peeked up and she was sitting on the top stair holding on to the railing. I told her to just scoot down one by one on her bottom if that made her feel better, and eventually she did come down. Has this happened to anybody else? Our stairs are carpeted, not very steep, and fairly wide, so it’s not like they are sketchy stairs to begin with. I just don’t understand her sudden aversion to staircases and wonder what I can do to reassure her that stairs are not the worst obstacle in the world."

Hello everyone my girlfriend and I are in desperate need of help .9 week old baby almost 10 . if she’s awake and not being held she is most likely crying . She usually doesn’t sleep for more than 5 hours at a time if ever . As i’m typing this is 730am and for the third night in a row she hasn’t slept for more than 30 minutes through the night and has seriously not calmed down in hours . this is every night and day of our lives lately . she hates being swaddled . refuses pacifiers and bottles doesn’t like her feeding pillow . doesn’t even give her bassinet a chance . sometimes she goes down for a few minutes in her swing ( her only happy place ) and then flinches and wakes herself up only to be up for another hour of nonstop crying we are going crazy especially because we  can’t drop her off at our parents . We are at our wits end and it’s having a very serious impact on our relationship . Please give us some guidance  or a little light at the end of the tunnel . thanks
My son is almost 20 months old. He has always been an amazing sleeper. Mom started to ween a bit from breastfeeding and IMMEDIATELY he started refusing to nap. We are going on day four of no nap now and he just cries and cries but doesn’t even want to breastfeed really. He goes to sleep at night but only after crying for 45 mins. The only place he will fall asleep is on me (dad) and as soon as I put him down he freaks out. When we sleep trained we did the whole go in every ten minutes and comfort without picking up thing and that worked great. Now that just pisses him off more. Has anyone experienced this? Help!
"LO is currently 7 weeks and we’re using the SNOO in our bedroom until he’s too big but with all the Mother’s Day sales going on I figured now might be a good time to get a baby monitor for when he transitions to a crib.

Things to note:
We have the Owlet sock which we plan to use but I’ve heard very mixed reviews of the camera, curious to know what others have thought

We’ll hopefully be traveling a lot once this SAH order ends, any cameras that are easily portable?

We are in a rental and crib might need to go in center of room anyway so I’d prefer something that doesn’t require a wall mount 

Appreciate any and all advice!"
"Like the title says, during this pandemic my husband finally started working as a nurse and he’s working all the time now. I’m talking like “2pm-1am” 6 days a week or they’ll ask him to work. Right now it’s not a problem because I work in a bar so I’m obviously not working. He wants me to stay home with our 1 year old and not go back. Even though that makes sense it’s driving me crazy and I’m freaking out. How can I have a better attitude about staying at home and not make my husband feel bad everytime he leaves for work. I know my attitude needs to change but I just feel so trapped being with the baby all the time. I don’t even know who I am anymore. All I do is cook and clean and take care of my child. Work was my escape and that’s what I’m trying to get him to understand. He gets to go be an adult and his own person but I’m always just mama. All the time."
"I’m (38F) a stepmom to 2 teenagers, one is 15F and the other is 17M. 

The 15F child lives with us 100% of the time, she doesn’t want anything to do with her Mom. I should mention that I do not have any children of my own, the only kids on my life are my partner’s children who I love very much. 

The other day 15F admitted to me that she took her Dad’s phone when he and I first met and read our text messages. She said she also did this with previous girlfriends he’s had over the years. There’s been a few times I’ve come home to find my papers have been moved or looked thorough (bills, prescriptions, letters, etc). She is known in the family for being a “snoop”, but nobody seems to think it’s serious enough to discipline her for. Whatever, she’s not my kid, and its not my place to discipline her. 

But for the last few months, we’ve caught her spying on us many times. She sneaks down the stairs and sits on the stairwell, watching us and listening to our conversations. She even told us she does this. Her very passive father (47M) doesn’t really say much about it. He certainly does’t punish her in any way whatsoever. 

I’m not sure what to do in this situation. I don’t want to overstep my bounds but this sneaky behaviour is really bothering me. It feels like I always have to look over my shoulder when I’m in my own home (she also enjoys jumping out from behind doors and scaring the shit out of me about once a week). 

That said, her and I have a good relationship, about as good as can be expected in a stepmother/ stepdaughter situation. I don’t want to ruin things with her, but I’m starting to get really pissed off. 

One thing to mention is that she has very low self esteem and not many friends. I’m not sure if this plays a role in the spying behaviour, but it’s worth mentioning. 

Any advice?"
"We have a computer in the family room of our house. My 12 year old has a cell phone but it doesn't have internet service. Because of distance learning he has been using his school issued laptop. It is only supposed to be used for school but he has been asking to take it up to his room on the weekends. I am against this for two reasons. The first is that he signed a contract with the school saying he would only use the device for school related reasons. Second because I don't like the idea of not being able to see what he's doing on the internet. I know kids can get caught up in a lot of weird things. 

I say he can still use the family computer. His siblings aren't on as much so it's not like he has to fight for time on it. He just wants to use a device in his bedroom. Thoughts?"
"Our 8 year old son has been doing online classes given the situation these days. He has access to the laptop and the internet and he is allowed to use it during school time only. We recently saw the search history and seems there have been searches for inappropriate images. He has done if for couple of weeks. We are devastated with this, which is more because of our failure to enable safesearch on the laptop and have parental restrictions. We spoke with him and he was very sorry for the behavior. He explained that kids in his school spoke about certain things and that got into his head. So he searched for it (months after his discussion with his friends). After his first search, his curiousity led him to keep looking for more. His searches are non-sexual in nature, but some of them would show very explicit and sexual images.

He has promised that he won't do it again and we have activated all types of parental controls on the laptop. We are just trying to understand on how this may impact his behavior in the future and what should we do. Apologize for the long post, but we are truly at a loss on how to handle. We never expected anything like this at this age, both of us lost our sleep thinking about this. May be we are overthinking, but we concerned about the impact it may have in the future. We don't want to blame our kid and see it more as our mistake."
"My boyfriend owns a machine shop, his twin 10 year old boys have expressed interest in making and saving money, we're taking this as an opportunity to teach them some financial literacy skills and my guy will soon start bringing them to work with him so they can make some cash.

Now - obviously the boys can't work on the CNC machines themselves. These are machines where grown men can't even wear their wedding rings, they can't wear gloves lest something gets snagged and their hands are dragged in and ripped apart.

My man's business partner just pulled out the weeds so that's out of the question. Also, the windows are too high for the boys to reach them/not gonna risk it with ladders.

Any ideas for tasks the boys can do around a machine shop? We thought of office type stuff like stamping envelopes however that's just not needed.

Decided to reach out to the parents of Reddit.. thoughts? 🤔🤗"
"Our child had colic. If you know what that's like, you know. You get it.

Parents of non-colicky kids would say, oh, yes, my child also cries a lot. But I'd see them out with their child, capable of having a relatively normal day without 24 hours of agonized screaming, or at home enjoying a break or a nap, and I knew they just didn't get it. 

Anyone else feel like this? Like we got a totally different parenting experience from our friends and relatives who didn't go through it?

Edit: Obviously, there are far worse things than colic, and I don't mean to diminish the experiences of parents who have children with more serious conditions."
"So, its exactly like the title says.  My four year old is potty trained, has pooped in the potty at least four times.  He is refusing to poop in the potty, and will only poop in a pull up.  We have attempted to not purchase pull ups but he will hold it. For Days.   I certainly don't need him to have any issues so we have to go to the doctor right now. We have tried taking things away he treasures, and we have tried giving him rewards. We have tried buying him cool toys as incentive (my mom has a bunch just waiting for him to poop in the potty). To no avail.  He has to poop in a pull up in my bedroom or his own bedroom. No place else will do.  Do we just not even ask him anymore? Rationally I know he will not go to college in pull ups but I feel like I'm losing my mind.  HELP!"
"I have quite a situation now at home. With schools (and nurseries) closed and my wife and I working from home, we had to hire a full time nanny so that we can both work, it’s a very cool girl who plays with her and is on top of things while we are working. Then, when we finish work, we will play with her and give her attention. 

The thing is, whenever the nanny has to go out my daughter starts crying, yelling, basically she enters in tantrum mode and when we try to calm her down she says “I don’t like mom... I don’t like dad.... I like only Melissa “ (let’s say the nanny’s name is Melissa).

This happens not only with the nanny, happens with anyone who comes to visit.

Has anyone faced this? How do you guys handle it??"
"Moms asleep for the night and don't want to wake her for this.

I'm talking full crab-walk-pose kick. She wasn't biting, or even growling, she was laying down in a non aggressive manner. We've had instances in the past where either dog would be dragged into his room to ""snuggle"", just to hear a yelp after a couple minutes. 

So I witnessed this through the window as I was walking from the barn to the house. I saw red. I went inside and asked him what had just happened. He tried to tell me a different story about her biting his hand and growling. I took very will lit videos and photos of his hands including him pointing to where she ""bit him"" for mom in the morning when she asks where his game console and television are. I'm shaking. I asked him why he would ever hurt either of our dogs to the defense of her aggressively presenting herself.

Currently back in the barn trying to find out how to handle this and how to explain to a child the severity of hurting animals out of aggression.

Thanks all!"
"So my son is approaching 6 years old. His mother and I split almost immediately after he was born. From that point onward it was nothing but constant struggle and strife.

Custody battles, pissing contests and boatloads of drama ensued. It took me almost a full year to win access because of the hearings getting dragged out, and another year to get week-about access. A year after that I won custody during the school year with his mom getting weekends and split summers. This is where we sit now, except with us all isolating we have been fast and loose with access as our school routine is shot for now.

My ex has 7 Kids, 4 older, our son, then 2 twins born just around Christmas.

The last 5 years have been a cycle of conflict and a short period of civility between them. The last few months though I had noticed a change in my ex. I'm trying to pick my words carefully because I'm not looking to frame her as the bad guy. Her life is just really hectic and it became clear in court that I could simply provide a better focus on our son in the school year. She was pretty hurt by the decision and resentful. Some of our conflicts were clearly motivated by that resentment, but that's pretty human, so I don't hold it against her much.

Back to the point though, I had noticed her being more co-operative, kinder... friendly even. Now I didn't think much at first, but after the civility kept on for multiple months I couldn't help but hope this would be the new normal.

Over the past few days we've been talking and I guess her marriage had been declining. Don't get the wrong idea, she's not looking for, nor am I looking to be a plan B.

Struggling with all that I guess really helped to put things in to perspective for her. Helped her see my motivations were not of spite, but in the genuine best interest of everyone involved. Now with the lockdown she is swamped and is actually really thankful that I am so dedicated to our son. Unfortunately the other dad's are not really involved, including the newest one.

Out of nowhere she told me today that: ""You are a great dad and our son is so lucky to have you. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but you set the standard by which I judge other men as a father."" I think today I can confidently say we have reached a plateau in co-parenting. What a massive relief to imagine that a half decade of all consuming conflict is behind us.

I just wanted to share the relief I feel in all this. Sometimes its so hard to co-parent when you don't get along. I'm not going to lay all the blame solely at her feet. My expectations are maybe a bit high sometimes, but for her to say those words to me *in writing* is actually a pretty big deal for someone as proud as she is.

Hope I'm not jinxing it, but I feel like we're over the hump and both committed to our son first and foremost for once."
"I have a 5 month old son that slept through the night until a week ago. He used to sleep from 8-6:30 and over the past couple weeks has started waking earlier and earlier. He started waking at 5:30am and now wakes and 3:30-4:30am since I started trying to put him to bed closer to 7-7:30 (I read an earlier bedtime can help). When he wakes up, he does’t cry just makes loud sounds that we can’t sleep through. Rocking and even feeding don’t work to put him back to sleep, he just wants to be awake for 1.5-2 hours. He seems to be confused about when wake up time is. We are also in the modst of transitioning from 4-3 naps, which I think is part of it since his naps are all over the place. I am very open to sleep training but have a couple issues that are holding me back. He is exclusively breastfed and has had weight gain issues. Right now he breastfeeds to sleep at night and for most naps because he will feed for much longer when he is falling asleep. When I try feeding him while awake, he is distracted and won’t feed for long. I am worried if I sleep train and stop feeding to sleep, he won’t get enough to eat, but maybe he will adjust if I commit to it? Second, he now sleeps in the Snoo and we may be about to move. He has one more month til he needs to transition out of the Snoo, so I am wondering if we should sleep train in the Snoo or switch to his crib and sleep train there. These are the thoughts running through my brain at 5am, any insights would be appreciated!"
I have a 9 month old that I just noticed started to babble a lot less for the past week. He used to say a lot of mama baba dada gaga but now on a daily basis he’ll say papa sometimes and that’s it. He makes other new sounds but no words. Also his top 4 teeth are coming out all at the same time and he’s trying to crawl and stand up and walk. Have any of you experienced that with your little ones? Can the teething bother his mouth to say his usual sounds
"Like everyone, me and my little ones are going crazy being stuck in the house all the time. I’ve tried to find activities and games to keep us busy. I’ve been playing a lot with my 6 year old (almost 7years). her behavior has been really off recently. Mainly just backtalking, not listening, arguing and things like that. I know she’s going through a lot and adjusting to social distancing and she’s also adjusting to being a new big sister to a 2 month old. But I’ve started to realize that she has a hard time separating play time from serious time. I think that when we play together, she sees me as a friend and forgets that’s I’m also an authority figure. Also In our culture, most parents don’t play with their kids. I want to continue playing and doing fun things with her but I also need her to understand when to play and when to be serious and to remember that even during play, I am an authority figure. Any advice?"
"I’m located in a suburb of NYC. I have a 3 year old and a 3 month old. My partner works full time and is great. But, holy shit do I miss my mother helping out. 

I have weekly crying fits, is it postpartum? Is it anxiety from the situation? Is it being yelled at by a toddler? All of that. 

We are wanting to expand our bubble to my parents. My Dad goes to his office 5x a week where he is pretty much isolated, they have masks etc. My mother does her grocery shopping 1x/week. The only person they interact with is an older uncle who is having a hard time with all of this due to loneliness. 

Another twist is my brother and his wife are desperate to reintroduce them, they are like us and don’t go out at all besides exercise. 

Someone please tell me it’s okay to have my parents reintroduced into my routine. Or, if this is a terrible idea?"
"This post is about my postpartum depression, so if that is triggering for anyone I recommend not reading. It took me a while to be able to even talk about it, and I would not want to upset anyone who currently suffers from it.

Also, I'm sorry this is so long. I just need to get it all out because it's been nearly 4 years and lately I've been feeling it hard...

I am a mother of a 3, almost 4, year old boy. My pregnancy was terrible, like many people's, and I could not wait to just get this thing out of me. I couldn't wait to have this new chapter of my life start. But when he finally arrived, I felt... numb. The lead up to his birth was weird as well so I thought for a bit that the actual birth and postpartum stay was anticlimactic because of that. One nurse did my IV wrong, the anesthesiologist botched the epidural so he had to redo it, the other nurse had me start pushing at 9cm while my OB was with someone else in another room. It all felt hectic and weird but simultaneously like ""eh... whatever. It's almost over.""

And then I started pushing. It didn't take long. I wasn't cursing out my significant other or screaming or anything. My son had the cord wrapped around his neck but I was born the same way so it didn't phase me. He didn't cry right away so they whisked him off to the other side of the room to get him breathing. But I felt nothing. I birthed the placenta, my OB stitched me up, my son started breathing and crying. They put him on me for the first time, I looked down at him. Nothing.

I thought I was just in shock or exhausted or something. They got me into a wheelchair, still holding my son, and brought me to the postpartum wing. My improperly done IV leaked blood the whole way and no one noticed until we got there and I said it hurt. (As a side note, I will never return to that hospital...) I sat on a toilet for at least an hour trying to pee but I obviously couldn't feel the lower half of my body at all so it took a while. I also had no concept of time at this point; everything is a blur. I just know it took forever.

I finally got into the bed in the postpartum wing, my son latched like a champ and drank his fill. That was the only time we got him to latch. The lactation consultant gave up on me after a few weak attempts and no one told me when their shift ended. My son didn't eat for hours despite us paging the nurses every half hour for someone to help us feed him. But that's a complaint for another post I suppose... We got him bottle feeding and he was fine.

My significant other did most of the caring for the baby. I slept. A LOT. Even when I was awake, I didn't want to hold him. I was in so much pain and discomfort from the tearing and I didn't understand why people weren't more sympathetic to that. It didn't compute in my mind that I was supposed to be completely in mom mode and I felt absolutely nothing.

On the final day before we were discharged, I looked at my mother who was visiting and said ""Something isn't right."" She got a nurse immediately, we talked, postpartum depression came up. They immediately got a psychologist in, I filled out a survey. They booked me to stay for another day, with my son even though he was still discharged on time. They scheduled appointments for me with a therapist and a psychiatrist for the upcoming week.

I did everything I needed to as a parent in spite of struggling with PPD. My SO did very little aside from staying up at night, but that's also a topic for a different post. It was more or less my sole responsibility to care for this child that I felt nothing other than a vague obligation to care for. I cried more than anything else. I cried while I fed him, I cried while I rocked him, I cried on the way to his pediatrician appointments. I slept like a rock at night and felt no motivation to get up when I would hear him cry, even when it was my turn to care for him.

I should note that I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was a teenager and have been struggling with those my entire life. So that combined with the PPD was almost unbearable. I wanted to die. I never wanted to harm my son though. I didn't feel compassion towards him but I felt no ill will either. He was just a baby; it wasn't his fault my brain was working the way that it was.

I felt the numbness towards him less and less over time; months and years of time. It wasn't until around when he turned 3 that I finally felt confident in saying I no longer suffered from PPD. I still felt, and feel to this day, the regular ups and downs that come with being a parent. But now? Now I miss him when I'm away or when he's sleeping. I smile genuinely when he giggles and acts silly. I love him so much, this little man he has become. I keep looking over at him as I'm typing this and I can finally feel my heart swell with love the way it's supposed to.

I don't want to have more kids. Between how awful the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum were I just couldn't handle doing it again. But I'll be damned if I don't wish I could go back and experience that moment differently; when they put him on my chest and I looked down at his weird little face. I wish I could have smiled and meant it. Welcomed him into the world with love. I wish I could do it again."
"I talked to her last night, and explained to her that she hurt me. I told her why what she said upset me so badly, and I made her promise to never say anything like that ever again. She didn’t say anything and just walked back into her room, shut the door, and didn’t come out all night.

This morning, she wrote me a note that said she was sorry for “being a bitch” (in her own words) and made me cereal in bed. We practically spent the whole day in my bed laying down and watching Netflix together. I know it seems like nothing, but it really meant a lot to me because we used to do that all the time when she was a little’n.

Thank you all so much to everyone who commented and gave advice! ❤️"
"Hi all! My son is just over 3 months old, and I'm thinking about how to move away from feeding him to sleep, but have no idea how to do so.

He falls asleep independently for pretty much all naps (sometimes there's a late afternoon one he's too worked up for so I wear him, but less and less these days), so I know he's capable of doing it - he has a range of self soothing techniques, like head rubbing, slamming his legs down onto the crib, and sucking his fingers. We don't have much of a routine - nappy change, chill in the nursery together (blinds closed) in silence/low voice talk for a few minutes, sleep sack and dummy. The past 2 days I've tried to add reading a book during our chill time with the thought that I'd do the same at bedtime. He naps on average 4-5h a day.

However, I got into a bad habit of feeding him to sleep at night - when I was in survival mode those first few weeks I just did whatever worked, but now I'm trying to move away from it (ideally before the 4 month regression hits!). Our ""bedtime routine"" (again not much of a routine) is (bath if bath day but we don't do it regularly yet), nappy change, into pjs, side-lying nurse in the dark. By this point he usually falls pretty much 99% asleep at the boob, and I transfer him to his crib. If he wakes up during the transfer it's very brief and he'll go back to sleep pretty quickly. He sleeps on average 10h a night.

So how do I move away from this to put *something* (book?) between nursing and sleeping? Do I wake him back up? I feel like that's likely to rile him up and he won't sleep well. Do I do it slowly by keeping him up for like 2mn one night, then 5mn another, etc.? How long do you need between ""feed"" and ""sleep"" to avoid the sleep crutch?

Baby's sleep is sort of my obsession, even though he's a pretty decent sleeper (mostly independent sleep for naps, sleeps in his crib at night, night wakings only take 15mn ish because he's an efficient eater and I have a fast letdown), so I'm *really* keen to establish good habits as soon as possible. TIA!"
"Hi all,

After we pulled our 2yo son out of daycare die to the lockdown, he has been waking up earlier every day. Today he woke up at 415am. He has traditionally been an excellent sleeper, going to bed at 7 and wake up at 6 like clockwork. I think it is a combination of getting less exercise/stimulation and being excited to be with mama and Baba all day.

He is tall and can vault out of his crib, even though I've dropped the mattress to the floor. He will open the door and start crying loudly before he reaches our door. It will sometimes wake our 5mo son (another reason we want to regain that sleep!).

We try to tell him to go back to bed, or have one of us lie down in his room to comfort him, but he always fusses and gets up. He is clearly still tired - as I'm writing this, he is sleeping on me on the couch, something he hasn't done in months. 

We try to tire him out, we played a bit of soccer yesterday and built a water table for him to play with. He falls asleep just fine and is ready to sleep at his normal bed time. He just wakes up at ungodly hours.

Any advice, from one exhausted parent to another?

Hang in there, friends."
"I flaired this as an update, but of course it\`s also Corona content. Feel free to change the flair if you feel like it suits my post better. I hope that this one is all within the rules and stuff like that, I\`m not exactly sure on how update posts are supposed to work.

Anyway, nearly 2 days ago I posted \[this\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/gb0mm7/9yo\_daughters\_best\_friends\_mom\_has\_the\_virus\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/gb0mm7/9yo_daughters_best_friends_mom_has_the_virus_my/)) post on the subreddit. I will copy it here, just so you can see it:

&gt; Huge warning for everyone wo gets anxious about the Corona topic!  
&gt;  
&gt;I really hope this won't get deleted, and I'm trying to make this as much about my own daughter as I can.  
&gt;  
&gt;My 9 year old daughter just found out from her best friend that her best friend's mom has the virus. The mom is a nurse and we live in one of the most affected states in the US. She's apparently been sick for a couple days and got her test results today. I don't know any details other than that the mom is not in the hospital and apparently currently in ""mild"" condition.  
&gt;  
&gt;My daughter's best friend is 9 as well, they are in 3rd grade together, she just texted her the news.  
&gt;  
&gt;My daughter is super worried for her friend and her family (mom, dad, 5 year old brother). She's crying in her room right now and keeps asking me if there's anything we can do. She knows it's not that severe for most kids, but she's still scared of her friend dying or losing one of her family members.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have NO idea how to comfort her. Is there anything I can say or do to make it better? Should I let her take the rest of day off from home-schooling (we've still got an hour or so to go) or just call home-schooling quits for all kids today? I'm leaning towards yes. I just stepped outside her room to type this because I feel like everything I can come up with to say now would kind of just make it worse. I don't want her to be traumatized by this event. What can I do to support her through this, emotionally? And how can we emotionally support her best friend and her family?  
&gt;  
&gt;I really hope this isn't going to get deleted and I also really hope I didn't trigger anyone's anxiety. Sorry, guys. Just really need something to say to my 9 year old 

I wanted to give you guys an update on how it went, and thank you for your advice and suggestions!

First of all, an update on my daughter\`s friend\`s mom: She is still in mild condition (about a week after starting to show symptoms now) and does not require hospital care at this time. However, all family members (the husband, the 9 year old and the 5 year old) are showing some symptoms now. Neither of them are in danger right now, especially not the kids, but they haven\`t been sick for very long, so, we\`ll see. The parents are in their mid-to-late 30s and aside from the dad being a smoker and slightly overweight, they don\`t have any health conditions.

After going on reddit for advice last time, I cancelled home-schooling for that day for my 14 and 11 year old (and asked them to watch the youngest). Then, I went back to my daughter\`s room to talk to her. I told her I wanted to be there for her and that she could tell me everything she\`s feeling right now. I asked her what\`s going on in her mind and heart.

She cried a lot, and we hugged for a long time. She told me that she was extremely worried that something could happen to her friend\`s mom or the rest of the family. I told her that they\`re all fairly young and will most likely just feel shitty for a few days, and that it will almost certainly be mild for the kids. I asked her why she\`s so afraid of them dying (she knows people can die from it because she has asked me lots of questions about the pandemic and I answered them all as honest as I could without freaking her out too much). She then showed me the text messages from her friend. 

Her friend was absolutely freaking out, mainly because it was her own family that\`s affected, and she texted my daughter stuff like ""What if my mommy dies?"". She apparently knows about Covid deaths from her parents. My daughter\`s best friend isn\`t the type of child who can openly talk to her parents, since she doesn\`t want to overburden her mom, and her dad often yells at her for crying and stuff like that (something I have talked to him about, but we aren\`t really all that close). Anyway, it seems like my daughter was the only one she could share her anxiety with. I told my daughter that it\`s great that she\`s there for her best friend in such a tough situation, but that she should always step out if she feels like she can\`t handle it anymore and doesn\`t have to feel guilty about that.

My daughter told me that she hates seeing her friend go through something so terrible. She also told me that knowing someone with the virus made it much more real to her, and that she can\`t see it as something that\`s far away anymore (obviously paraphrasing, she is only 9 and had a lot of trouble putting that into words).  I told her that I understand. I also told her that, after they\`ve all recovered, she might be less scared because she sees it\`s something that people can and do recover from.

After the conversation, I asked my kids to spend some time together, and my 11 year old son and her went to his room and played there. During that time, I called the best friend\`s mom. I checked in with her about her condition. It was very obvious that she was sick, but she assured me it isn\`t life-threatening and right now she\`s just staying home trying to get through it. I told her about what had happened with her daughter, and she felt really bad and said she would try to calm her down as much as she can. I asked if  they needed anything, and she said they\`re running low on groceries, since none of them have left the house since she first showed symptoms. I told my daughter and we picked up some food and basic necessities from the grocery store. At home, we cooked them some food, signed a little self-made ""get well"" card with a picture drawn by my daughter, and then we dropped all of that off at their front porch. 

Yesterday, we tried to keep everything as normal as possible, but we spent more time on our journal entry sharing time than we usually do (we have Corona journals and write a page every day, to share it with everyone else on the table during home-schooling). 

Speaking of home-schooling, though, the schools open on Monday and I don\`t know what to do. My 14 year old desperately wants to go to school and see her friends while the others absolutely do not, and I can\`t exactly send my oldest if the others don\`t consent, since everyone else in the family gets the virus if she gets it. Plus, I don\`t think it\`s safe to send them anyway, do you think I should just keep them all home? Home-schooling isn\`t a problem for me per se, I just don\`t want to throw my 14 year old\`s needs under the bus.

Thanks for reading my update. Could you give me some feedback on how I handled it and what I could do better if that happened again in the future? I was absolutely at a loss when it first happened."
"I'm looking for advice on ways to manage time spent playing computer games for my 7 year old daughter. She was fine pre-lockdown but now with her regular activities cancelled, no playgrounds, playdates &amp; school I've been letting her play on the computer a bit more.  However I noticed a sudden increase in negative behaviour, especially when being told it's time to stop playing on the computer and are wondering how to best deal with this situation.

I want my daughter to develop a healthy relationship with gaming and to learn self-moderation, so I don't really want to outright ban computer games but perhaps I'm asking too much of a 7 year old?  Or perhaps she's just struggling with lockdown blues like the rest of us!

Anyway, any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated."
"Looking for age appropriate books that explain where babies came from as well as dealing with the changes that a new baby brings.

"I’m a trauma social worker in a an emergency room. Since my oldest child was born we’ve always had the same routine when I get home from work of cuddling/nursing right when I get home then getting ready for bed or the day depending on if it was a day or night shift for me. It’s been the most consistent part of my life for 4 years and I didn’t realize how much my kids relied on the consistency. Now, I get home and they can’t touch me until my clothes are in the wash, items are sanitized, and I’m showered and in fresh clothes. During that time period my kids are so distraught because they can’t get cuddles and loves. We’ve taken to having my partner take them on a walk when I’m 5 minutes from home so I can get home and shower and be ready for them when they are back, but it’s sad to work a 12 hour shift and come home to an empty house. Covid sucks. How are all the other essential employee parents holding up?"
"My youngest son (13) has become the most unruly, unbearable, and sometimes the least liked child, (forgive me, I’m at my wits end). He has been out of school for about 7 weeks. The district decided to incorporate “distance learning” and there is no grading system, it’s either pass or no pass. 

To date, he is 39 assignments behind, the majority are math. I’m “essential “ and have been working through this whole ordeal. The father has asthma, therefore he was placed off work for the whole time my son has been out of school. 

Regardless of the fact that we are getting a divorce, he is still in the house. I get constant emails of my sons missing assignments. I tell his father, I need help , you’re here , I’m at work, etc. What is the problem?

It has gotten so bad, that his teacher(s) began to text me , ( I used to work at the school he attends) asking me what’s going on, is everything ok? It’s embarrassing. So the last response I gave was the fathers email and phone number &amp; I asked that they would include him ; and they have, yet here we are , my son is still 30+ assignments behind. 

Today, I am fed up, DONE. Prior to arriving I text my son and asked about his homework. His responses are subtle little jabs about his math teacher which lets me know, nothing is complete. I arrive, tell the father, get his PS4, pack it up. That’s when the melt down begins. 

He’s screaming how he hates his teacher, she just wants him to fail, how she makes him feel like committing suicide, killing him self ..
(Read that again, committing suicide. ) This is the 3rd time he has said that in last 7 weeks. I don’t know whether to take him seriously, or if it’s a fit over the PS4 being taken away? (The reason why I say that, is because, whenever the device is put away due to behavior , grades, etc , he will have a fit and start grasping at straws, you guys never loved me, you’re only mean to me,and he will compare his situation to his siblings)
I told him If he keeps talking like that, He’s going to the hospital, or the police take him to juvenile hall.

I don’t get any help, support, or reinforcement from the father. It’s an ongoing battle. I don’t know how to help my son or even where to begin?  I feel like everything I do is in vain. It’s to the point that I don’t even want to come home. It’s at the point that I don’t like him, who he is becoming, and if this is a preview of what’s to come, I don’t even want to be apart of his life anymore... 

Quarantine has made my household, my kids, my livelihood TOXIC."
We thought we were good to go until today but now we think we are going to suffer another miscarriage 2nd time in a row first time shortly after the at home test after we were late. This time it’s after the doctors blood test. It just hurts I needed to vent and we have been absolutely blessed with a beautiful daughter who is now two. Thanks for listening.
"I'm really upset and venting. My son is grown and lives in another state. He has schizophrenia and bipolar. He's in a psych hospital for about the 7th time since he was 16. But I've always been there for all the visitor days and now I'm not and he's so bad right now, I'm so worried. And I just don't know what to say...he calls daily, 3-4 times a day to keep me updated. The depression, it won't get any better, all these years and meds and therapies and nothing helping, ever. They found something to help the schizophrenia and mania, which enabled him to finish high school and get a really good job with benefits and move in with his boyfriend! But nothing ever stops him from not wanting to live. He just is in a permanent state of ""wanting to leave"" and wants someone to give him permission to. I'm like, ""Sweety NOBODY is going to tell you you can do that. Nobody will say that."" He says he is so tired of fighting to stay here for other people. All I knew to say was he is important, my heart, I won't ever give up believing he'll find the right combination of meds and therapy to help him. 
One of the issues is when I divorced my ex, my ex slowly stopped having anything to do with our kids. This has hit my son really hard. He frequently texts his dad, getting no answer. He called him all day today from the hospital and my ex wouldn't answer. I fucking hate him and how he has hurt our kids."
"My baby will be 6 months soon so she will be starting to eat baby oatmeal and one ingredient vegetable then one Ingredient fruit. When do I start adding different flavors or mixture of baby food, cheerios etc. What was your feeding progression from baby oatmeal to normal food?"
"Due to some terrible circumstances my husband and I had to take in his 2 year old niece. She will be 3 in June. We have an 11 month old baby boy already. I don't exactly know how long she's going to stay with us, but it could be a few weeks or months. I need advice on how to parent her. 

She isn't potty trained and she refuses to brush her teeth. I've tried everything to get to brush her teeth but all she does is cry and throws a tantrum. The potty is the same thing. I put her on it and she says she can't go, but then an hour later she'll go pee in her pull-up. So if someone could please give me advice with how to get her to do both of these things I would appreciate it.

My niece is also refusing to eat lots of things. I think she's used to junk food. She doesn't really want to eat anything else. How can I get her engaged in wanting to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner? 

I'm pretty sure my sister-in-law also treated my niece like a baby with no expectations or routine. My niece is used to getting her own way. So everything seems to be a fight with her. She thinks that crying will get her way, but I don't budge and she isn't used to that. I want to get down to her level and make her understand but it's difficult.

She is also scared of our 11 month old. I don't know why. He's very happy and he hardly cries. Is there any activites that they could do together to help form a bond? 

Finally, my niece always asks for her mom. I've explained to her that she's having a sleep over with auntie and uncle for a few days. This works for a little while, but usually around bedtime she starts to freak out and screams to go home and that she wants her mom. I feel terrible when she does this, but she has to stay with us. How can I explain to her that she can't go home?

Sorry for any mistakes. Things have been pretty hectic over the last few days."
"Planned on adopting a toddler when I was 40ish assuming everything was going well. My doctor said It would be very hard to get pregnant on my own. I thought that was great. I am 27 years old now and 27 weeks pregnant. I found out maybe 3 weeks ago. (couple periods a year if any &amp; false negatives 2 months ago) I grew up close to Amish with beatings, biological dad leaving, and poverty galore. My husband had a rough time growing up too. I'm terrified of being a parent. I know how to take care of a toddler and older, but I have no idea how to take care of a baby. I am patient and nice to a fault so I know I won't be abusive, but I don't know what it takes to be a good parent. My husband keeps having panic attacks about not being able to do this and freaking out which freaks me out. We have a house, but it still needs lots of work. After seeing the ultrasound I kinda fell in love. I want to raise him and give him a great life. I feel like he is going to grow up to be someone awesome. I sometimes feel like I should give him away to someone who has experience and enough money to bribe a school board (lol), but that's not what I want. I always felt like I wasn't good enough for my biological dad to stick around when I grew up so I'm worried he will feel that too. I want and love him, but I'm worried I'm being selfish. Opinions? Advice?"
"He doesn’t eat a goddamn thing I put in front of him. He is 5 and doesn’t like spaghetti and meatballs, cheese quesadillas, sandwiches of any kind (especially not PB&amp;J), buttered egg noodles. All he wants is hamburgers and hotdogs. 

He also has sensory issues and every single fucking pair of socks and shoes I buy, he hates and kicks them off immediately and yells “IT FEELS WEIRD I DONT LIKE IT”. He has stopped wearing underwear because he “doesn’t like the feeling” of the elastic on his waist.

So I guess we’re moving to the jungle and he can just be naked every day and eat fruit off the trees. Yea."
"He'll casually mention it every now and then in conversation as well as when he's playing with action figures.  Today he said, ""mom, if I was dead, I could take my head off and hold it"".  When playing (with toys or us), he'll karate chop or shoot a nerf gun and tell us we died or something similar.  

I'm pretty on top of screen time and what he's allowed to access in that regard.  Sometimes I'll ask him where he heard it from and he'll tell me ""in my brain"".  I try to redirect and basically tell him ehh that's not super fun to die when we're having fun playing, but that hasn't worked too well.

All that to say, is this normal?  I don't think my son is a criminal or anything but the death talk doesn't sit well with me."
"Just brought baby girl #2 home yesterday and BOY OH BOY is this going to get fun! #1 cries when the baby cries but seems to really be interested in her otherwise. #1 has given me a few looks of sadness like she knows she won't be getting 100% of the attention and I've already cried.

Husband had to run into work to handle some things and we are smoking a roast. He took #1 to my mom's since it was almost nap time and she was getting fussy while the baby was asleep and I need to watch the smoker. 

I am beyond terrified and keep asking myself what we were thinking having 2 under 2 but I know it will be worth it. Solidarity?"
"Hello everyone: 

I have pretty much confirmed that my 12 year old is at least bisexual and possibly gay. He uses my phone to text his friends and I've seen enough of his notifications without snooping to be able to read between the lines. 

Important note: the fact that my son is very likely gay does not bother me at all. Rather it is the reaction from his mom that I am not sure of how to handle. She is super religious and believes that homosexuality is a terribly sin and I am not sure how she will react but I doubt it will be good. When her brother came out she was firmly in the anti camp and they no longer have a relationship. While I don't want my son to be ashamed of who he is I also want to be sure that he is safe around his mom. 

I haven't spoken to him yet but my gut tells me to talk to him first then decide whether to bring my wife into the loop. It may be better if she doesn't know. This is a thorny situation and I'd like to see what people here think. What steps should I take?"
"Our son turned 3 last weekend. Leading up to the big day, we started taking about the Binky Fairy. The night before his birthday, we would gather up all of his binkies and put them outside of our front door, where the Binky Fairy would collect them during the night to give to other little kids. She would then leave a gift in exchange for all of his binkies. We thought this was genius.

Our son seemed to go along with it just fine, maybe with a little hesitation, but he was excited about what the Binky Fairy would bring for him. Prior to this momentous night, he slept with no fewer than three pacifiers; one in his mouth, and one in each hand. The night the Binky Fairy came, there didn't seem to be too much of a problem that he didn't have his usual three binkies, and the next morning, he was thrilled by his gift from the Binky Fairy.

The next few times he went to bed, for his naps and for the night, he asked about his binkies. We gently reminded him that the Binky Fairy took them to other little kids. He still seemed to accept this fine, but we've started noticing that it is getting harder and harder for him to get to sleep. He was such a sleeping champ before, and we don't mind him quietly playing and chatting to himself after going to bed. That's not really the problem. The problem is that he is now becoming a monster to get to bed. Before the binkies left, he was very agreeable to getting ready for bed. Now it's a crazy fight for both naps and bedtime, complete with chasing around a naked toddler as we try to get him into the bathroom for his last pee and for tooth brushing.

I think we've gotten into a vicious circle. He's not able to self-soothe as well without his pacifiers, so he doesn't fall asleep as quickly, which means that he's running more and more tired, which makes him even grumpier. Add in the fact that we also have a 9-month-old who hasn't figured out how to sleep later than 5am, and we've got an understandably cranky toddler. What then ends up happening is that our son's craziness at going down for his nap is now waking up his little sister, thus repeating the cycle of Baby waking up too early in the morning and creating an even crankier toddler combined with cranky parents.

So, dear Reddit, do you have any advice for two exacerbated quarantined parents? We're running toward the end of our rope, and we are seriously missing daycare.

P.S. Baby sister does not take a pacifier, so we shouldn't have to go through this again!

P.P.S. He sleeps with stuffed animals and his favorite blue blanket, plus we often let him take a favorite toy to bed for added comfort. This was all status quo prior to the arrival of the Binky Fairy."
"Pretty sure we all are one more "" Hit your brother one more time"" convo away from calling Nanny 911. At this point I'm also at "" I don't think that's a good ideal""  to atleast wear a helmet, phase as well."
"well, it's here. the question i've been dreading to answer for the past 5.5 years. when i got pregnant, i was at a really low point in my life and for the first 3 months of my son's life, i thought his dad was someone else. cut to a paternity test later and i was able to talk to the man who was his father. he came around for a little bit, most of the time under the influence...he claimed him, posted him on his social media...they look so similar. i told him he couldn't come around while being high. he left for a while, and now he's clean and living a good life and 2 years ago told me he looked nothing like him and he wasn't his then blocked me. now, my son is asking about his dad because i have another daughter and her father is very involved. my son asked me last week in the car and i finally said it, ""he isn't around and i have no idea where he is. you don't need him. you have so much love as it is."" i have no idea what to say anymore, because the questions keep coming. help me. please. i grew up without a dad so i know the damage it can do....my heart literally breaks for him. i'm angry at myself for doing this to my child when i should have been trying to break the cycle. i'm at a loss and really need advice!"
"Yeah.... I may be crazy if I actually pull this off.... 
also, My first post ever on reddit.

My older brother who I get to see about once a year lives in WA. I’m in CA. We are roughly 18hrs a part. He has a wife and 2 daughters (3&amp;7) and I have my husband and a 1 year old daughter. Fortunately they were able to all meet each other at thanksgiving this past year. Well with all of us laid off and on lockdown, and haven’t been around other humans in 2 months, my husband and I have decided (I think) to drive to WA and quarantine with family for a little bit. Also it will be a great help to me because my baby is a mommas girl 100% and when she’s with other kids it gives me a little break almost because she’s so entertained... I guess I’m looking for people who have experience traveling with a little one.... or on a long ass car ride like this. Will I regret it 5 hours in? Will i lose my mind?"
"I have recently wound up with custody of my three year old, so we are now together *all of the time*, especially with the current situation, having to stay home as much as possible and all that. So I've come to notice that it seems as though she talks constantly. I get to a point where I'm not sure what to do or how to respond. She's talking *to me*, expecting some sort of response, as she'll repeat herself and raise her voice if I don't respond, but it's sort of like she will either tell me to look at something she's doing many, many times in a row, or ask the same question over and over, or even just call out each thing a character on a program is doing as they're doing it. It's just a constant stream of talking. 

How do I teach her that it's not appropriate to make someone answer the same question many times over, or to demand that they watch you do the same thing a hundred times, or that watching a program isn't pleasant when someone is shouting a recap of each thing as soon as it's happened, without making her feel badly? She isn't misbehaving at all. She's had a bit of a rough time recently with a lot of changes in her life and I am always patient with her, but it concerns me that other kids won't be so kind, and that if I don't explain these things to her somehow, she will be shocked by their negative reactions once she's in school or in a social setting with other children again. 

I have tried to explain it but since she's still doing it, it doesn't seem to be working. I don't want to be harsh or make her think she's in some sort of trouble. She's not. She's just being unwittingly annoying but is otherwise innocent. I'm hoping some more experienced parents can give me some ideas."
"Why do I love it!? I remember reading it was the sweet smell from breast milk, but she’s 4 now! When she yawns I secretly sneak a whiff.  But I doubt when she’s 12 I’ll want to smell her not brushed teeth/mouth."
Hello all; my child is 4 and a half years of age and still is wetting his bed! I tried everything! Recently I’ve heard of the bed wetting alarm... would you recommend? And what type would you recommend!? Many thanks.
"She is fairly open-minded, but still, I'm sort of worried about leaving a negative impression on her, when it's so different from what she is accustomed to."
"Any/all advice is appreciated. 

I’m not worried about my finances, I’ve always been pretty good with money and I’m financially stable. My only concern is the kid itself, I have no idea how to be a parent.

The mother isn’t going to be in the picture either, so I’m pretty much alone in this. I’m also concerned because I was also raised by my dad and he wasn’t really a great parent. I’m deeply concerned that I’m going to be like him. 

Anyways, I don’t know how I’m supposed to act around/take care of an infant, and I’m sure things are going to get even more complicated as they get older. I’m also terrified to do anything wrong because babies are impressionable."
"Okay so I need help. My husband and I have no idea what to do any more because are 15 month old won't stop biting us. He bites when he is angry. He bites when he is playing. He bites when he wants you to move your hand or foot off something so he can get it. And they are HARD bites I have bruises on my arm from his bites. We have tried sitting him on the stairs for a cool down time, telling him ouch that hurts! That's bad! Turning all of our attention to the person he has bitten.. ( so far he has only bitten myself and his Dad ) we have tried just putting him down on the ground and ignoring him for a minute. Nothing has helped he is still biting and I think it's getting worse! He is currently teething and getting his molar so that doesn't helped but he still has to learn he can't bite. So I guess what I'm trying to say is how have you gotten your 15 month olds to stop biting?"
"Hubby &amp; I are first time home buyers on the hunt for the right house in Chicago! A place we have in mind would have our master bedroom &amp; 1 tiny bedroom for our soon to arrive baby on the 2nd floor, but the only other bedroom (also tiny) is on the 1st floor. We hope to try for another kid as soon as we can after this guy and are wondering whether having this layout would be a mistake. What experience do other parents have with this layout? Would it be a nightmare having your 2+ year old on a different floor at home? Or some unexpected benefits? Should we just stuff both the 2 y.o. and a new baby into the tiny 2nd floor bedroom?? TIA!"
"My son has hit the terrible twos a bit early.  He has the attitude of a 16 year old with his first car that’s never been told no.  My 6 year old daughter didn’t really seem to go through this stage, or at least nowhere near as bad, so I’m at a loss.

He’s bitten my daughter three times in the last two days.  I still have claw marks on my hand from early this morning because he didn’t want his diaper changed.

I need the discipline to be visible to my daughter.  She already feels like he can get away with murder and when his behavior just gets written off as “oh he’s just a baby” (not by me) it has an adverse effect on her behavior.

Suggestions?"
"I've been having video visits with my twin daughters for the past month. One (E) is a little shy though, and tends to clam up when the other one (J) gets chatty.

Due to the mother's tomfoolery, J was 15 minutes late to the visit. Was a blessing in disguise, though.

Shy E spent the time telling me about her cat and his antics. Was some quality time I wouldn't normally have had with her. It was nice."
"So with this whole lockdown/pandemic/Covid fiasco, we decided it was as good of a time as ever to potty train our 2.9 year old. My oldest just turned 5 and I REALLY wanted a summer without diapers. 

We started last week. First two days were hell, as I expected. Everyday after that got better, and now she’s doing really well- I set a timer for her to go pee every 90 minutes, and she’s been increasingly more vocal with her need to go potty as of the last few days. 

She has been pooping on it-the trick is getting her there quick enough. She looks at us with a literal “oh shit” face when she needs to go, and we rush her to the potty. Sometimes there’s plenty of warning, other times it’s a mad dash. But, usually once a day, she gets too immersed into an activity and poops without realizing the fact until after she’s already done it. Today she looked at me and said “oh no” and I pulled down her pants and a massive poop rolled onto the floor. This was after she went potty earlier and did a small poop so I had a feeling she was going to need to go again. 

My oldest was SO easy to potty train, and I know it’s an ongoing learning process, but what can I do to help with this? We bought her some special baby shark underwear and reminded her how happy the sharks would be if she kept them clean and dry-she seems to be taking that pretty seriously 🤣. Any tips?"
"As the title says - the singer has a nice voice, I’m interested to know who it is and if they have any original work. IMDB only shows the composer not the actual artist. Asking on this subreddit since probably the only other people hearing the song are parents!

"Hi parents. My partner and I are looking for advice on how you run your households. We’re hoping for insight on US-based public school scenarios. 

We are both full-time healthcare workers. We have two kids, one 3.5 years old and one 2 years old. Looking toward when they go to school (the oldest will be starting TK in about a year), we’re a little lost about how to handle things like school drop off, pick up, sports or extracurriculars, and so on. 

During non-covid times, they go to a daycare/preschool center from like 9 or 10am to 5 or 6pm. My partner and I work opposite shifts so whoever works late drops them off and whoever works early picks them up. It’s very leisurely and flexible. But that’s not how ‘real school’ works and we’re trying to think ahead. 

How do you parents do it? Does someone have to step down and be part time or stay at home? Or do you hire someone to be their drop off and pickup person, do homework with them, and fill those gaps you can’t attend to? How do you decide what to “make time” for by requesting time off work or arranging a different schedule? 

It seems so daunting to balance wanting to provide money and opportunities and financial security and wanting to provide time and physical presence. 

Thanks for reading and thanks for any insight you can provide!!"
"My 8 month old has never been a great napper, but now she's combining it with walking up early, too. The last couple of weeks she's had several days where she's woken up from a nap at 2pm. I'm never sure what to do with this. Try to keep her up until 6 and go to bed early? Or try to force another nap at 5pm. Neither of these have worked well. She's either exhausted by bedtime or she ends up being wide awake until 9pm. Neither seem to affect what time she wakes up in the morning, either.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
"Looking for a good book on raising girls, and a lot of what I see on Amazon is religion based, looking for something that's not. Actually the step-dad in this situation so that would be fine as well. Girl is 1.5 years, just FYI. Thank you."
"My boyfriend of 2 years with no children of his own seems to think so and frankly I'm annoyed when he points out something to me that he feels is unfair. He is very helpful and even researches ways he can be a good parent, but I  try to explain to him that a lot of parenting is done in the moment and depends on child's personality, time and place of discipline, age, etc.I have four children male and female ranging in ages 4 to 9. Am I justified in being annoyed or do I need to go back to parenting 101?"
"My 4 year old girl, 5 this year refuses to go to sleep unless I sit outside her room on a chair, eventually when she's done fighting to keep her eyes open she'll finally fall asleep, a few hours into the night she'll wake up and get in my bed, sometimes I'm awake and I'll take her back, sometimes I don't wake, we've tried incentives, reward charts, punishments. She does not care one bit. Would rather go without. I'm at wits end sometimes I can spend up to half hour sitting there waiting for her to fall asleep, i explain to her everyday and night where we all sleep, that it's safe, and I'm just in my bedroom and I'm pretty sure she understands but gives no fucks.

She's like a night owl she has always hated sleep. 

I want my bed back, i want my time back and I fear I have just created a rod for my own back."
"So I’ve got my 2.5 year old (my first child) going pee and poop on the potty, incentivized by a little Easter egg chocolate if she sits there long enough and does a pee or a poop. She won’t sit there unless I offer the chocolate. So the idea is in her head now and she gets what to do, but how do I get her to the point where she is telling me she needs to go potty out of habit, instead of sitting there for half an hour because she wants the chocolate? This is my first kid and I have never done this before, obviously."
Title kind of sums it up. I can't take this. They won't sleep for more maybe 30 minutes. They are up crying 10+ times a night. Probably averaging 11 times. It's seriously affecting my relationship with them. I feel animosity towards them for ruining my sleep. Ruining my wife's sleep. Making it impossible to get work done. My wife and I are ok so far but we haven't been able to have a meal together for weeks. We don't live near family so we can't get a break. I'm so so overwhelmed. We're working with a sleep specialist but nothing is making any difference. I feel terrible for feeling like this but I just don't want this kid in my life probably 90% of the time these days.
"My son is about to be 4 and before he turned 2 he would eat everything I put in front of him, but after his 2nd birthday it seems he didn't want to eat anything I made him. He eats about 10 things in total, he won't even eat cake, candy, or cookies. I feel awful only feeding him junk like macaroni, ravioli, and chicken nuggets but I feel even worse starving him. I try my best to put veggies and fruits in his diet but it's super frustrating when he notices the change in his food and refuses to eat. Also my husband is a picky eater as well so I feel like he inherited that from him, I swear I feel like a short order cook sometimes making separate meals everyday. How can I get my son to eat more nutritional foods?"
"I feel like a moron posting this, knowing that no one can provide a definitive answer to such a vague issue, but here I am anyway.

I send my kid to a preschool that has 10 children. I am newish to the area and most of the other moms are longtime residents who are friends.  I'm not close with any of them but we are friendly enough—if we see each other at the grocery store or whatever, we say hello.

This week was my son's birthday.  Due to social distancing, I couldn't throw a party.  But I arranged for the local fire dept to come by with their truck to run the siren and say happy birthday. 

I emailed the entire parent group—they all literally live within a two mile radius, and invited them to join the mini parade.  I said they could park or hang out on our lawn and I would deliver favors curbside.  Not a single parent even replied to say they wouldn't make it.  

It's not like my kid knew the difference and he had a great day, but I feel worse than the kid who gets picked last in dodgeball.  

What's the etiquette for shit like this? Shouldn't at least one parent have said, ""Happy birthday—thanks but no thanks""? A piece of me feels like I need to self-examine and see how I could have possibly offended any of these people, but I find it hard to believe that I could be so off-putting when our interactions are limited to cordial hellos. 

Do any of you simply ignore invites without meaning ill will? Am I crazy? Let's say I am the asshole: do you normally prohibit your kids from attending parties if you feel sort of meh (or worse) about the birthday child's parent? 

I feel awful and am stressing that by the time my son is conscious of what's happening, he will have friendless birthdays. He shouldn't have to suffer because his mother isn't likable."
"We are considering buying a backyard playset/swingset for our sons 3rd birthday next April.

We are unable to build our own due to some health issues so we will need to get one online.

Any suggestions for some good ones? We would really love a model with 2towers and a connecting bridge so it can grow with him and get a little use from his 12 year old brother.

We seen a couple nice looking sets from gorilla and backyard discovery but am wondering if there are others we have not found yet. Our budget is about 5k ( which would include installation)

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated."
"My daughter has lots of energy. Usual for a near 5 year old. Anyway, she doesn't stop climbing on us unless she is distracted with a gadget or TV. It's very frustrating. Sometimes I am ok with it, but quite often it's rather annoying. I don't want to punish her because it is not really something bad, but when she starts, if we tell her to stop she won't. We got her a scooter in an attempt to have her use her energy on that, but because of current lockdown we can't go out to fun places and have to limit her time outside, so it's a big struggle.

We are currently living in Airbnb after Airbnb, so we can't really purchase anything big for her to use. Does anyone have any suggestions? How can we get her energy out, without involving climbing, and if we do get her energy out will this stop this constant behavior?"
"Hey, everyone! My son just doesn’t play with toys much. Should I be worried about his development, or is this normal? He really couldn’t care less about anything plastic that lights up, etc. He just doesn’t really care for many toys. 

He has a set of small stainless steel pots and pans that he likes to bang spoons on. He enjoyed putting lids on containers and filling boxes with items. He also enjoys holding on to small objects and carrying them around (tv remote, duplo block, wooden spoon, etc.) He likes his wooden block shape sorter, but hasn’t figured out which shapes go in the correct holes yet. He does like these automobile magnets I got for the fridge. He mostly just likes to open and close things, pull out drawers, and empty and refill containers. 

Anything that requires you to push buttons, lights up, or makes noise he just isn’t interested in. He doesn’t love stacking rings but will do a couple of the larger rings before losing interest. 

What are your thoughts on this? Is my child secretly a genius lol and too advanced for these mere childish toys? Or is this something my baby is missing that is critical to his development?☹️

He qualified for therapy at 12 weeks old for 20% delays in both motor and cognitive, but he was a preemie. I feel he’s on track with milestones now, but he is receiving therapy still."
"Today my two year old told me to go sit in the Pause Chair (our version of time out) because I got frustrated with him. At first I was like, BITCH YOU AINT THE MAMA. And then I was like, No wait you should absolutely always call out authority when they aren’t following the rules of the land, and/or are being unloving. 

So I sat my ass in the Pause Chair and we set the timer for 2 minutes and then we hugged when I was done, and I got a lollipop 💁🏼‍♀️

Let’s normalize authority figures making mistakes and honoring the consequences of those mistakes, otherwise parenting just looks like one giant power trip."
"We are eighteen days in to this parenting thing. Trying to get some ideas of what else we have to look forward to. I imagine most of these “laws” will be humorous, but any are welcome. The law I’d like to start things off with is; no matter how much or how little your child has slept, they will always be awake when it is time for you to sit down and eat."
"...and just sent him to his grandparent’s house for the first time in 2 months. Since COVID started I’ve been with my 6 month old all day, every day while my partner works. He’s been growing and developing at such an incredible rate. We’ve bonded so much. And it’s so hard for him to be gone. 

My partner’s ma keeps reiterating how good this is for me. I can’t get over how many assumptions she makes about my parenting. I love my child so fucking much. And she’s pretty crazy. So. Just working through the motions of being separated from the wee one."
"I have 4 year old b/g twins. About a month ago we separated them into their own rooms. It’s worked out really good for them.

At bedtime I read my daughter a story, and then go to her brothers room and read him a story. He took the room split a little harder than she did, so for about 5 minutes every night I sit in by his door while he starts to fall asleep. 

Tonight was no different. I read my daughter her book, gave her a kiss, and started to walk to the door. She looked at me with her sweet face and said “I hope you have the sweetest dreams”. My heart melted. She was so genuine in that statement. It made me feel so warm. 
I made my way to her brothers room. Same routine. After I finished his book and gave him his kiss I sat by the door like usual. In the darkness I hear a sweet voice say “I hope you have the sweetest dreams”. Twin moment! 

Their rooms are nowhere close to each other’s in order to hear the other say that. It felt good hearing it the first time, but it was even better the second time from my son. 
Sorry for the random post! It was an amazing parenting post and I hope everyone has sweet dreams too!"
"I have a 4 month old and a 3 year old and, as you can imagine (and relate to), I've been going a bit crazy. My mental health has suffered and tbh if it weren't for my kids I don't know how I'd even get out of bed everyday. My 3 year old who absolutely loves seeing her friends and family, going to preschool and groups etc. has just gracefully accepted this is how life is now. She'll very occasionally remind me that preschool is closed and that she can't see her friends or play in the park, then just gets on with it. How is a small child who's life has been turned upside down just so accepting? It's honestly humbling and has blown my mind."
"I am a new dad to a 6 months old son. He turned 6 months just few days ago. He had been exclusively breastfeeding until now, but we plan to start solid food something like Nestle Cerelac and also continue breastfeeding. I am just eager to know about feeding him water? Is water essential once solid food is introduced or is breastfeeding sufficient for hydration? Also his sleep is disturbed nowadays, he wakes in the middle of night and starts to cry. I would love to hear suggestions on both of my issues."
Help! I have an 8 year old who still wets the bed. he stopped for a few days but now we’re back at it. even if i wake up at 11 to use the bathroom it’s been happening. his younger brother hasn’t wet the bed since he was 5 hooray! what can i do for the oldest?!
"Background because our life is crazy:

My husband and I are out of work. Me due to this COVID mess and my husband due to health reasons. My husband does not get SSI, but we are in the process of applying again (his first time was denied). We have a 14 year old and a 5 year old. Both have Autism. Our youngest has a developmental delay as well. He is a bright boy, but lives firmly in the concrete world and has trouble with comprehension of abstract things. We've been trying to connect more with each other (husband &amp; wife) because taking care of two disabled boys is all consuming. Before this happened we were already on edge. We have no family that will take the boys overnight. We have no friends that will. We do not qualify for respite care. We cannot afford a babysitter. We're on our own out in this world. Also, we don't have a working car so we can't take him for a drive.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week our 5 year old decided he was done sleeping forever. He had a bad dream and was never sleeping again. We tried to talk more about dreams to him, but the concept is too abstract for him to understand. He believes that the things are really happening. We tried reading social stories and watching shows with dream sequences. I tried explaining that dreams are like ""silly movies that your brain makes up"". He then wanted to know where Netflix was in his dreams. After some back and forth he gave up and decided that we were not telling the truth. He thinks they are real and wants 100% guarantee that they will stop or he's not sleeping again.

We've tried saying that his giant stuffed Yoshi will 'eat the bad dreams', but he has trouble with imagination and responded with ""Yoshi isn't real"".

We tried reading about dream catchers and making our own. Didn't soothe him.

We also are not allowed to sleep, as he doesn't want to be alone. He fears that he could suddenly fall asleep and have dreams. It is our job to stop his dreams from happening. He is most concerned about ""being alone in his dreams.""He is angry at us for not following him into his dreams and helping him. He has had many dreams but the following dreams are ones that have upset him greatly:

* Our dog was throwing pickles in his shoes and making a mess.
* He was flying and couldn't land
* He was being chased by a lava monster
* Spiders were on the wall dancing.

Here is how things are going now:

We do our nighttime routine. He falls asleep at 8pm, wakes up at 11pm and then every hour after that for 20-30 minutes until 6am. He won't sleep during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried:

* Weighted Blanket
* Stretchy Sheets
* Noise Machine
* Night Light
* Eliminating Screen Time
* Extra Walks
* Deep Breathing Exercises
* Social Stories
* Positive Reinforcement
* Sticker Chart
* Sleeping in a preferred place
* Allowing him to just be awake in our room so we can sleep
* Asking the school for help. (They didn't/haven't gotten back to me. I don't know what they can do though)
* Asked his Pedi. They brushed me off, saying it was a phase. He then suggested Melatonin. That gave him freakier dreams (Spiders Dancing) and make things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing works. Now we're on shifts so one of us can sleep while the other can handle him. He basically has a meltdown every time he wakes up and we go through the same 5-6 questions while he's screaming, throwing things and hyperventilating.

""Why was I asleep? I hate sleep!""

""Why did you let me sleep? ""

""Why do I have to be all alone \[in my dreams\]?""

""When is it morning?""

&amp;#x200B;

It's torture for him and it's torture for us. This can **not** go on. I'm 100% sure he'd break down the door if I tried to just lock the door and sleep. That's not safe anyway so it's not even an option. The one good thing is that our teenager sleeps like the dead and doesn't wake up for anything, so he has not been affected. I don't know why younger son 'allows' older son to sleep or what is thought process is. Frankly I'm not about to ask becasue that will start problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit what do I do?"
My son is almost one. Should I get a seat for him to ride on the back of the bike or a trailer for me to pull him in. What do you and your kids prefer? I personally feel like the trailer is probably safer but I think he would have more fun being right behind me. Let me know what you think!
"I know it’s not like a milestone or anything but I’ve been waiting for 21 months for my son to give me a kiss back and in the last week he started to give me a goodnight kiss when I ask. About an hour ago we were reading and in his book the puppy wants a hug and kiss before bedtime. My son, after we read that page, put down the book turned to me and gave me a big hug and kiss. I just about melted right then and there. I love him so much and it means so much to me. I just needed to share I’m so happy right now."
"My son has always reached for my hair. I should've stopped it when he was younger, but we're here now. It's not from anger, it's almost like a comforting thing for him to hold my hair and suck his thumb. Now he's gotten a bit more strength and pulls a bit, so I take away his hand each time and tell him no until he moves on.

Is there something else I can be doing or something I can give him to help him self-soothe? He's not attached to any blanket or plushie yet."
"I’d like some advice on how to teach my child 2 languages. He’s only 4 months old but we want to have a plan in motion. 

We currently live in an English speaking country. My native tongue is English but my husbands native tongue is Arabic and there is a possibility we will relocate to an Arab-speaking country in the near future. What is the best/easiest way to approach the situation?"
"I am looking for some software (preferably) or hardware based solution to control access to specific websites and Apps, right from the DSL Router/Modem.

The inbuilt parental controls at Router level are useless except for time restrictions on internet access. The website are blocked only at port 80. Any website or app using a non standard port can not be blocked.

Do you know of any effective firewall kind of software which can be used after or with the router to examine traffic and effectively block websites/apps etc.

Thank you for any advice."
"My 5yo is having a hard time lately. She lives with me full time, and rarely sees her father because he lives on the other side of the state. He used to live only 20 minutes away, and she'd see him every other weekend and some weeknights. When he first moved she seemed to understand because he was so far she couldn't see him as often. 

A short while after he moved, he disappeared for a few months. His parents called around that New year's asking if she could go visit them for a week. When I picked her up, she started crying in the car and said ""my daddy's in jail"" after this revelation he started writing her letters.

He was released about a year ago, and since then has acquired a new partner. She seems lovely, and my 5yo likes her. They live with his parents on the other side of the state.

 Recently though, my daughter becomes upset if someone gets mail and she doesn't. Today I got a package, and she was on the verge of tears. I asked what was wrong and she said
""I don't think my daddy cares about me anymore. He stopped writing me letters ever since he met [girlfriend] and he doesn't want to hang out with me.""

My heart broke, I didn't know what to say. She then said
""Maybe if I draw him a picture of a car he'll want to write me letters again"" I hate she feels like she's the one who needs to pick up the slack. He's 'made plans' to visit her multiple times since February but has never followed through.

I held her until she stopped crying, but I don't know what else to do. I want her to know it's not her fault he hasn't written letters or come to visit, but I don't know how to do it without her feeling like I'm bad mouthing her dad."
"So my 3.5 year old eats breakfast which relatively healthy but throughout the day he refuses to eat throughout the day. He doesn't like to eat a variety of food either, it's either apple, banana, white rice or bread.

I am really concerned about his eating habits I also have a 2 year old and that kids eats everything thats on the table and continuously eats throughout the day. I am not sure how to help him and if I need to get professional help but I wanted to ask the community if this is normal.

He's not eating any meats at all or vegetables"
"So, im a single mom of two young kids. My house gets trashed pretty quickly and I often don't have energy to clean. My house is either: super clean because I cleaned it top to bottom, or the downstairs is super clean but the upstairs is trashed, or the whole house is just trashed with piles of dishes in the sink. I try to keep up but I'm one person and i prioritize play over cleanliness (much to my landlord's annoyance... i swear she must have chased her kids around with a handheld vacuum when they were little because she cant comprehend why my house isnt immaculate 24/7)

But, here lately, I've managed to get a bit done each day so its clean but theres still shit everywhere and I like it like this. Not clothes strewn about or crumbs in the carpet, but paints and paper on my dining room table, toys out of the bin on a clean carpet, my dishes are washed, counters bleached and my bathroom is clean. I'm spending the same amount of time with my kids because I'm doing a little bit at a time and letting those things go.

Anyway, just wanted to share. Hope all is well with yins guys out there in the wide world."
"Apologies for formatting. I'm on mobile. 

I have two step children in their teens. When they're here, there's a bit of discourse. They refuse to clean up after themselves (I don't mandate they clean up after adults), will fight me on bedtime when their father is asleep, take zero direction from me, and view me as the live-in maid/nurse/teacher. I'm used to that. 

What I can't get used to is the food situation. They will eat from the time they wake until they sleep, and if you're not the first to get food, you're probably not eating at planned meal times. If I get to dinner late and head to the fridge, they're right there, grabbing the food before I do and making sure there's either very little or nothing left. For the past two years, I've been having to deal with the reality that when they're here, popcorn is my one meal a day. That's also gone to hell, because they've started attacking that, too. 

I've discussed it with their father at length, and have spoken to them about it, too (""Don't go for seconds or fifths until everyone has eaten""), to no avail. He excuses their behavior with ""It's just genetics"" and when they're called out on anything, it's ""I forgot"". When I finally give up and just retire to the bedroom for the evening in defeat - no screaming, no fits, no outbursts - I get glared at or talked to later for ""being ridiculous"" because I regularly give up.  

Their mother refuses to speak to me due to religious differences (Christian vs. Pagan), so I can't communicate with her (I've tried). Their father just brushes it off and doesn't see the issue. I have no idea what to do, here. Advice is greatly appreciated. 

(Please be nice. I'm starving and fragile)

**EDIT: ""Bedtime"" is the wrong word, here. Bedtime is the time when they turn in electronics and finally wind down for the evening, not ""close eyes and sleep"" time."
"I already have a 2 year old who I tried to breastfeed and hated it, so switched to formula at around a week in. We're not trying to have another baby now, but if we ever do, I think I'd just go straight to formula from the start. 

One of the other reasons for this, is because once we switched my daughter over to formula, she started sleeping longer stretches at night, like 4-5 hours instead of 1-2. I'm wondering if I started with formula right away, if they'd immediately sleep longer stretches, since the formula keeps them full longer."
"My 14 is always testing her boundaries.  Here lately, she has really been brave.  She tried to pierce her cartilage after we told her we would take her to a professional to get it done.  So we never told her no, just haven’t been able to bc of covid. Anyway, she brought up casually during dinner and it made me husband mad.  He told her she should wait for us to take her and her response was “at least I told you, I could’ve did it and not told you anything” to which my husbands response was “But you did it! After we said to wait!” So this went back and forth a few times and I finally just asked her “do you take us for a joke? Bc there is no effort on your part.  You don’t do chores and the only time you seem to want to speak to us is if you want something” (I didn’t feel like I was speaking out of context here bc it’s true). I feel like giving up. We’ve tried the strict parents thing, we’ve tried the “we’ll give you space” approach and we’ve run out of patience.  Is there any advice for parents of a teenager in this lack of respect phase? She is our oldest and maybe being cooped up has everyone on edge, but the lack of respect is going to make me crazy!! Thank you in advance!"
"My kids have been getting restless. It has been raining and cold, so we are stuck inside when we were already feeling confined. We got through all their school work, but it was a struggle because they want to be with their friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, they talked to their friends all day. They did a video call through the kidz app on Facebook. They played games on there, and then they took the phone around and showed them different games they each had. They laughed, they played, they were so happy. It is the happiest they have been in a while and it was so good to see. We do calls,  but it can be hit or miss because we are all on different schedules. This just worked out. Plus, these are good friends'  of ours. They were my best friend since middle school and one of my husband's best friends since middle school. They met at our wedding, eventually got married and had kids. Their oldest son is born exactly one year after my older daughter. They are birthday buddies and both in the same grade. I was relaxed because I didn't worry about what they heard and I wasn't worried about my friends hearing us in the background. The kids shared so I go some one on one time with each of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week has been challenging. I end each day with a migraine and I am exhausted. I needed the win and this was a reminder of how much they needed it, too. I didn't worry about the fact they were playing video games and using screens. I let them be and they behaved so well. I was so proud of all of the kids (and I made sure to text both of our friends to tell them as much).  I hope they get to have more days like this."
"And I feel like I can’t possibly be the only one. Please don’t downvote me to hell.

I love my kids. I’d lay down my life for them. But my youngest daughter is my favorite, and it’s been that way for a long time. I keep telling myself one of these days that will change. It hasn’t. We just click. 

When I had my son, I had absolutely horrid PPD and I didn’t bond with him until he was about 4 months old, once I got on a good anti depressant. He’s so stinking smart. From age 2 he was playing chess, doing math in his head, grasping concepts like gravity and the cosmos. He’s a good kid. The kind of kid who stands up to bullies and invites the kids no one likes to his birthday party because “they deserve to have fun like everyone else”. He’s always been so independent and it’s great but he’s not a cuddler or a hugger or one to even reply when I say “I love you”. And I tell him how much I love him all the time and it stings that he rolls his eyes or tells me “maybe I love you too” laughing. He pushes away when I try to show affection and has since the first grade when he rolled his eyes at school drop off and said “don’t be so obnoxious, mom”. 

My other daughter isn’t mine from birth, I met her when she was 9. I love her. She’s amazing, super smart, great student, fun loving, and is a great teenager. She’s talented at writing and is In band. She is a good listener and loves playing video games with me.

My youngest daughter is my favorite though. We bonded instantly. She was a hard baby. Never slept through the dang night like her brother. She’s a level 9000 clinger and I often wish for space, but she’s also so sweet. She’s shy, and quiet, and caring, she’s the kid that shares he coveted French fries at lunch with kids who can’t afford school lunch. I don’t know, we just think alike. She’s into art and dolls and makeup. I was a total Tomboy as a kid so that can’t be it. It’s hard to say, our minds just work the same? She can look at me and know what I’m thinking. She hugs me when she thinks I’m sad. She’s an empathetic person, and I am too. 

I’m rambling and trying to explain it. I can’t though. My heart hurts because I WANT to love them all the same. And I absolutely DO love them all. I adore them. I can’t even think of losing them without crying. Great, now I’m crying. 

I make sure they all have the same rules, chores, bedtimes. I’m not giving special treatment. I just, I can’t be alone? Am I? Am I awful for having a favorite child?"
"Hi all - my 8 month old is still up every two hours, because as a rookie mum I utterly failed to put him down drowsy but awake and developed a breastfeed to sleep habit. I know, what have I done right?  We’ve tried various gentle methods over the last few months and after 20 minutes of letting him cry it out the other day I scooped him up into my arms with a big fat NOPE! 
I’m keen to hear from any of you who used to be in the same boat with a baby 6 month+ who was up every two hours as they didn’t know how to self settle... when did they learn this on their own? CAN they learn it on their own? 

Share your wisdom and/or tell me your experiences please!"
"So I was wondering about methods to manage screentime for my Son (9) across all the different devices he might use.
 
The devices are:
- PC
- iPad
- Android Phone
- Android Tablet
- Nintendo Switch
- TV

Not all of them are his mind you but over time he uses almost all devices at least for a bit. 

Since I'm pretty tech savvy myself, my first approach was obviously to use the devices own possibility to manage screentime. And there are indeed some that handle that very well. But the big drawback is, if for example he gets an hour screentime on a weekday, and I set the devices to an hour, naturally he could just play switch for an hour, then use the iPad for an hour and so on. Also I don't want to limit him to one device per day because that would just suck.

So now I was thinking about printing some kind of list where he himself writes down the time he starts using a device as well as the time he puts it away, thus tracking his screentime himself.
Sure, that sounds convoluted, but the hassle is on his side, so I don't really mind ;). 

So yeah, that's my idea. And now I hope to hear what you guys do to manage your kids screentime.

oh and I'm explicitly not asking about how long the screentime should be or what devices are ok for a child to use. Also just keeping track by just keeping an eye on him doesn't work because with all the working from home and having also a 3 year old at home all the time that's just not doable.

Thanks for your suggestions in advance!"
"Disclaimer: When I feel angry or frustrated or that I dislike her I STEP AWAY. None of this is her fault. I just don't know how to manage these feelings.

My daughter is 3. My husband and I are in our mid 30s and stable in finances and our relationship. The current virus situation isn't helping anything but my feelings turned to the way they are now before this. 

I work part time in healthcare so I still work my normal hours, my husband is working from home. 

The bottom line is while everyone is gushing about the toddler years and how you can start to see their personality shine, I'm really starting to dislike my child. IDK what's wrong with me. I can't seem to reframe my thinking either.

She's always a mess. Always. She has long hair she refuses to let us cut which is always in her face and then she cries. Put a headband on her and then she cries. She always has food on her face, something she got into on her clothes, she bites her nails which we can't get her to stop (or she cries), there's always spit all over her hands. 

Her speech is normal for her age but I can't deal with it. I can't understand her. Then she gets frustrated and she cries. She's an EXTREMELY picky eater and even when I give up and just let her eat what she wants, mealtimes end in tears. 

She clings all. the. time. If I tell her ""Mommy's busy, we can play later"" she cries. If I assert a kind but firm boundary and move her to her room to play alone until I'm free, she cries. She's always grabbing me and clinging to me and hugging on me and usually crying.

If I let her pick what she wants to wear she decides she hates it and cries. If I choose, she cries. 

If I let her play with what she wants and it doesn't go or turn out exactly the way she wants, she cries. If I choose an activity she cries. If we take her where she asks to go (park, zoo, store, etc) something invariably goes wrong and she cries. If we don't, she cries. 

Mealtimes, bedtimes, playtimes, basically any time and days that end in Y are a never ending stream of crying. Then she starts babbling AND crying and *I can't understand her* and she KEEPS crying.

This child is never not crying. I don't even want to look at her stupid, blotchy, tear stained, frazzled haired face anymore and she used to be the cuddliest, most beautiful baby. I hate that I hate the sight of my own child but *all she does is cry*. That's literally ALL she does.

We've taken her in for almost every medical test imaginable. She's healthy. We've taken her to 3 different child and family therapists. Of course she didn't cry there. But in the car? Instant waterworks. 

The general professional consensus is that she's just a sensitive child and she'll learn emotional regulation, we need to hold reasonable boundaries and she'll grow out of it.

But I've given serious thought to leaving my husband so I don't have to deal with this shrieking little pest anymore and THIS IS MY CHILD. Shouldn't I be full of love for her even of she's difficult right now? 

I am at the end of my rope. I have nothing left. I don't know what to do."
"I used to love kids, but now I only love one and I kind of resent everyone else’s kids. My son has special needs and is developmentally delayed, and I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that my son won’t be like other kids, and can’t do things that other kids his age can do. And all of that has made me dislike other kids. I don’t want to take care of my nieces and nephews, or friends children. All I want to do is be with my son and I just need someone else to hear this. I can’t tell my siblings to stop sending me pictures of their kids, and I can’t just stop showing up to family events, so I end up just bottling it up. I told my wife this for the first time last week. She doesn’t feel the same way but she is super understanding and supportive."
"I’m working from home during the Covid crisis. My job has been very good to me through all of this and allowing for certain leniencies. The problem is I need to get work done but we have a three year old son who needs to be entertained.

My wife is pregnant with our second, 8 weeks along and full blown 24 hour sickness. Today she’s been on the couch not getting up for much but to try and eat and drink water.

The three year old is bored out of his mind. He’s constantly coming to my office for attention. Every time I come out for a coffee break or to use the bathroom he asks if I’m done with work. It breaks my heart to tell him I have to work. With her being pregnant, we don’t want to risk him playing with his friends. The neighbors across the street used to play with him all the time even with the quarantine because the parents were being super safe and we trusted them. This week they had friends from Washington drive down and now we won’t go near them.

My wife is trying but she just can’t. She played some video games with him but then started feeling sick again and had to lay down. I know we will move past this soon but I’m just frustrated.

The house is a disaster. The kid sits around watching TV all day and playing by himself with his toys. When she tried to get him to do some school work earlier in the week, he said he didn’t want to and she just gave up.

How can I get my wife the rest she needs, get my work done, and keep the kid entertained/engaged with something more educational?"
"For the last few months, my 10 year old girl has been showing signs of anxiety about sleep. She normally goes to bed about 8:00 and wakes up around 6:00 am. The last few months most nights ends up crying and completely upset that she can’t fall asleep. I tell her she can read, draw, color... She will be upset for hours. Often I will end up going to sleep before her at 9:30/ 10:00 and she will wake me up to let me know she can’t sleep. I have tried sleep apps, breathing techniques, counting. I am hoping it’s hormones. 

She doesn’t like sleeping alone, but I can’t have her sleeping with me every night. This is a new thing (2/3 months). She sleeps through the night once she falls asleep.  I don’t want to be mean, but where do I stop. I cuddle her every night for a few minutes, then leave her room. She then gets upset about not being able to fall asleep and comes to tell me she can’t sleep 1/3 times. I tell her she has never not fallen asleep, and to stay in bed. This has become our nightly routine and I don’t know what to do anymore..."
We have being doing remote learning for past 5 weeks. School is closed for the year because of the virus. We start at 9:00 am with my sons learning and we don’t finish til 2:00. Even then we can’t get done with all the work. My son is pissed off and cranky trying to get through all the assignments. Ugh!
"First thing I want to say is that I am not looking to judge anyone, I want to understand. 

I’ve seen so many young people being threatened with being thrown out..... and from their perspective it seems to be for such trivial reasons but that’s obviously not every case. 

If you cared to share, what happened? How did you reach the conclusion? Where did they go? 

My son voluntarily left home at 18 and I’ll be the first to admit, it was a good thing for everyone but I don’t know if I’d have ever got to the point of asking him to go because I will always feel responsible for his welfare (rightly or wrongly, I carry way too much parental guilt to be healthy)"
"The kids haven't left the house/neighborhood in weeks so I came up with a brilliant idea - **a weekend drive with a SCAVENGER HUNT!!!**

We'll drive around town and search for items on the scavenger hunt - never leaving the car.  **Fun, yet safe and quarantined!** 

Last week we did a regular drive and they were sooo bored!  So gonna try a drive with a scavenger hunt this weekend.  Wish me luck!"
"My kids, 10 and 12, are treating me in a much worse manner than usual. The typical manifestation is that they ask me repeatedly throughout the day for help with school work, and within seconds of me sitting down and trying to help, they end up yelling at me. “That’s not what my teacher wants!” “You are not helping!” “I am not a baby mom!”  I am a higher ed administrator with 10 years of teaching experience in STEM, and somehow they simultaneously want my help, punish me for giving it, and act like I don’t know anything. The whiplash is constant and infuriating. 

Additionally, any time I try to enforce rules or boundaries in any way, no matter how calmly, their reactions are over the top. 

I have stayed super cool and calm for the first 6 weeks of this and didn’t react negatively. Just stayed the course calmly and such, but the abuse has gotten worse over time. These last two weeks I have been pointing out their abuse and not tolerated it. Today I finally just lost it, and stormed out in tears because they both screamed at me within two minutes of their schoolwork starting. 

On one hand, I have been generous and kind through this period, with the understanding that this was going to be hard on them in many ways. But all I get in return is negativity and a lack of acknowledgement and respect that is a lot worse than normal. I am just at my wits end trying to work full time, provide gentle structure to their schooling, and maintain my sanity.   Thanks for listening to my rant. Would be happy to hear if anyone has any advice."
"I have 2 kids and am considering moving a 3-8 hours away from my extended family. I live 5 minutes from my mom and she visits us weekly. DHs family is also in town. We are just bored here. This is the town I grew up in and I'm 35. I feel bad taking the kids away from their grandparents and cousins. Anyone else moved away from extended family? Anyone stayed? Regrets?

Also we are not rich by any means so it's going to be a challenge money wise, but we still think it's doable. Also Im not a big fan of the schools here. We live in a very  conservative place and we are a weird quirky family. 

It's just hard leaving my mom. She is getting up there and my brother died 3 years ago. I have more siblings, but feel bad leaving still. She is like one of my best friends. My kids will be starting school soon. I feel like now would be a good time to find a new place to settle down..."
"Hi,
I guess I'm just venting about a relatively Minor issue that's over with but here goes my Amazon package for my son ( a colorful  backpack with a character from a video game I grew up with on it) arrived TODAY, at the previous address I lived at. I showed up in a facemask, stood 6ft back after ringing the current tenant's doorbell.  There was 2 boys that answered the door roughly around 8-12 years old. The mom came to the door seemingly annoyed, I stated I changed my address but Amazon used an old/ default address, sorry for the hassle, blah blah blah.  One of her sons handed me The backpack. No box or extra packaging. Just the backpack opened. I didn't say anything other than Thank you and I left. I'm in my car and there is toys in the backpack. Obviously the boys were playing with it. Annoyed and a little pissed off that my package arrived just a few hours earlier and they opened what I bought and allowed her kids to play with it. BTW, I'd did a change of address upon moving. Thanks for listening.
😩♥️"
"i noticed my newborn starts to cry in specific timeframe and stops in specific timeframe. I though it is about feeding or probiotic. I googled and on some parent forum i found it. I read about it and was surprised. 
it really helps to stop my overthinking."
"My left breast has gotten significantly bigger than the right due to breastfeeding. Before i only felt the difference, now it's visually different. How can I have the left slow down or have the right catch up? I haven't started producing milk yet so I can't pump although I've tried. Any suggestions on how to even them up? It's gotten to the point where only the left will leak and it's uncomfortable from how heavy it is."
"I get that toddlers can be challenging. Still I’m concerned about this development. If he doesn’t get what he wants, he screams, throws a tantrum, or alternatively will throw things in anger. Interestingly, when he doesn’t get what he wants he seems to cycle through requests or demands in an attempt to get something (like anything) that he wants...like I mean it seems like his goal is to regain the power he lost by not getting what he wanted. 

We do our best to ignore it like all the books say. I’ve also told him (sometimes afterward, sometimes later as a “talk”) that we don’t like his screaming, that when he screams it makes us want want to go away to the other room, that when he starts screaming that he will not get what he wants no matter what it is, that it won’t get him what he wants, etc.

Probably just a phase, but am curious how other parents have put an end to this kind of behavior."
"So, I'm one of those horrid parents.. I scream, I'm impatient, I don't like to play. Just all around feel like I'm going through the motions to keep my child fed, and clothed because that's my job. Lots of mental issues at play here and I just haven't quite gotten a hold on it yet. Please don't judge me on that, I do it enough to myself. 

With that being said, over the past couple weeks I've taken a step back and looked at myself and since then, I've been working very hard at being a better parent. 

About an hour ago, I felt myself getting a tad frustrated, so I decided I'd shower - my saving grace.

My awesome, fully potty trained 2.5yr old decides it's a good time to take a poop and she still needs my help: wiping, emptying her pot, washing her hands. 

As she's finished, in my wonderful soapy bliss I ask her to hand me the pot so I can dump it in the toilet; to avoid poop and toilet water being everywhere.

WELL!
 I FELL OUT THE SHOWER , SOAP, SH*T AND NAKED A$$ EVERYWHERE!! 

Usually, this is when the steam starts blowing from my ears and I start raging but I could not stop laughing. She's on the floor laughing as hard as I am, but she helped me up and even helped clean everything up. It's a strange moment to be proud of but man.. I really needed that. I now realize this can get better, I just have to reeeeeally keep trying. Anyhow, it's only noon but I think a glass of wine for me and cookies for her are in order. 


I'm not sure what my point in this post was but... cheers!!"
"In the past couple of months, my 3 year old has become a real handful. I understand it's a three year old thing and they call them threenagers for a reason, right?!?

Anyway, my question is, when she's not listening or doing as I ask, I tell her the consequences. Example: If you don't lay down in your bed I am going to leave without singing you sunshine. So, she continues to not lay down, I get to the door to leave and she says ""I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'll lay down now"" So I come back in and sing her sunshine. Is this the wrong thing to do? Should I stick to my guns and leave the room even after she's done as I ask?"
"I don't know if this is good or bad or just funny (my wife and I think it's funny) but my daughter will do a fake cry and then stop and look to see if my wife and I are reacting.

Example 1:

Since we're both working from home sometimes I just have to hold her in my lap while working. she'll get bored and loudly whine twice and immediately look at my office door since she knows my wife comes in when she cries

Example 2:

She'll be playing and it'll will be getting close to bath time which starts the going to bed process. she'll whine a few times and look up us. I assume she's hoping we pick her up and start the bathtime song and dance we do (she loves that)

&amp;#x200B;

Never any tears, immediately smiles when she gets the result shes hoping for.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share. working from home while she's this young has been great because we've seen so many developmental leaps firsthand"
"I have two children (6y,2y), and while I love them, I really hate being a parent. I think it is the lack of freedom that is the worst part. I constantly day dream about leaving my family just so I can have more freedom and time for myself. I don't mean leave forever, but to live by myself and having the kids every other week. Even though this means I still will be responsible for the kids 50% of the time, it still feels like more freedom than I have now. I imagine having a week by myself will make me better equiped to deal with (and maybe even enjoy) being with my kids in the week I have them by myself. It will also give me an opportunity to decide what to do with them, how and when.  


I never really wanted child #2. I told my wife that I didn't feel like I had the energy for one child, yet alone two. But she kind of persuaded me to get another anyway. She said she would take more responsibility for the children, so I wouldn't feel like it would be so overwhelming. Well, here we are 3 years later, and while she does take a little bit more responsibility, it is in no way sufficient, or close to what I imagined when agreeing with her on getting another child.

Feeling like this makes me a bad parent. I constantly want to get away from my wife and kids, I am angry and irritated all the time. I even have a hard time engaging positively in my kids activities (I have to force myself to do that a lot of the time), and I am afraid that they soon will pick up on this and feel unloved. I am afraid I will damage my kids somehow by staying.

I am also afraid of leaving, because I might regret it. I will probably miss my wife (I don't want to leave \*her\*, I want to leave parenting), and I might even miss not seeing my children every day. Moving out will mean there is no way back. I cannot regret that decision, if I make it.

I wish I could talk to my wife about this, but there is no way she will be able to stay neutral and supportive on an issue like this. She will feel it as an attack on both her and the kids (which is true to a certain extent)."
"How many times should I bathe my newborn? I hear 3 times a week or when they have a poop explosion but I would like some more thoughts on it. She was born the 25th of April, we gave her a bath the next day at the hospital and then on Tuesday I think."
"This will be the second mother's day that I would be observing as a mother. Last year I was working and had to work a double on mother's day. Not optimal but baby girl was only 3 months old. This year I am a stay at home mom and was excited to be able to spend mother's day with my mother, grandmother, and sister, but we can't because of the stay at home order. I know I should be thankful as there are much more serious things are going on. My husband is still working, we have a roof over our head, and all of us are healthy. I'm not mad I'm just disappointed."
"So I’m a stay at home mom with a 7 week old. My husband has recently gone back to work full time. 

As much as I would like to let him just relax after work, I also feel emotionally and physically exhausted by the time he gets home and would like nothing more than to just nap. Sometimes if we’re lucky the baby will nap with us, but that’s rare and most times we just go off on who needs it the most. 

Our baby also wakes up 2-3 times a night. Again, as much as I’d just like to stick it out for the whole night so my husband can be well rested for work the next day, some nights I just can’t. I exclusively pump and that along with nighttime feedings, is extremely time consuming and draining in the middle of the night. Some nights I’ll be up for two hours pumping, then feeding my baby, then putting her back to sleep. By the time I’m done with the whole ordeal, it’s nearly already time for her next feeding. This could take an hour maximum if my husband could feed her while I pump in the middle of the night and we could all go back to sleep sooner. Sometimes he does but then it ruins messes up his sleeping schedule and he has slept through work alarms twice now because of it. This is clearly not working for us. 

I believe that me being sleep deprived while taking care of our newborn throughout the day is equally as bad as him being sleep deprived at work.  

How do you guys do it, what kind of schedule have you guys found works for you, and how do we make this as fair as possible? If you have a daily schedule, what Is it and how do you stick to it with a newborn?"
"How do you guys do it? Specially nowadays. 

I have 2 kids under 2 yo, and it is hard to find the time and focus to study. My partner wfh fulltime (kinda flexible hours.) I'm just so tired all the time. When my husband is available to take the kids, usually in the afternoons, I am so tired already. I take care of the kids, tidy up the house, etc. I wish I can study when the kids have gone to bed at 9pm, but that's just not effective for me anymore. It also doesn't help that my instructor is making our classes extra harder than it already is.

In the weeks I focus on my kids and not get to study enough, I feel so stupid in class. But when I get a lot of schoolwork done, I feel guilty as a parent."
"He’s obsessed with the horror movie guys, pennywise, being his favorite. 

Hes always talking about shooting, or hurting people. 

I’ve never let him watch any of those kinds of movies- but he goes to Dads frequently. 

Help! 
All the kids in school are going to think he’s a weirdo, 
How do I get him to stop talking like that? 
I’m always telling him, we don’t hurt people. Not even bad guys- we protect people. We’re nice to people. 
But nothing I seem to say to him, helps, at all. 

Any words of wisdom here are greatly appreciated!"
"We are super excited!!

We are fostering a 3 year old, we've read a ton of information about child development a such but.... I need info based on your experience as parent !  
We have a huge list from furniture, clothes, toys to kitchen things - we have absolutely nothing as we were waiting to have the kid age before buying stuff. But the kid could be home in less than 14 days so were pretty nervous and excited!

We know he likes Paw Patrol (like any kid X'D) and cars. I plan on buying a few things he likes like a wood train, paw patrol clothes, block puzzles, books and anything that can help him with language development - things to make him smile and feels like home, as it's a big change for this cutie pie.   
But I want to know, what do your 3 year old love? What are the thing we might not have on our list and absolutely need?  
There's a lot of list for a new-born on the web, but not much for an older child! I really don't want to miss anything (we will buy as we go, but I still want to make him comfortable during his first few days at home :P).  
Do you have any ""rewards program"" that works well?"
"My boy is just over 4 months and he recently has started violently crying at every point of sleep, whether its a nap (when he's clearly tired) or before bed. We've tried adjusting to his schedule, creating a schedule, consistent routine, gas drops, star swadles, you name it. My wife is really struggling with the lack of success in all that we've tried. I'm holding strong that perhaps this will just take time, but maybe we are missing something?

Edit: thanks for all the comments so far. I've been seeing the big debate between CIO and Co sleeping as the bigger controversies. CIO will be a last resort at 6 months if this regression keeps hold.

We've also done swaddles, shushing, patting back/burping, feeding, pacifiers, star swaddles, puffy swadles, sound machines, black-out curtains, rocking, singing, tired but awake... 

I really hope its just the regression."
"Hi all, I have a bottle-fed 3 month old boy and up until about a week or two ago, he was eating fine from the bottle with some minimal fussiness with my spouse and I.  Now, while he is fussy with her, my spouse has had success with feedings and I have been unable to get him to feed at all at this point unless it is an overnight feeding and he's half asleep. Any other time, I slowly try to put it nipple in his mouth to latch, he just plays with the nipple in his mouth, sometimes he pushes it out or the nipple bends since he pushes it out and doesn't want to latch. After some time with this, he just gets frustrated and cries. Rinse and repeat until either my spouse feeds him or I give up.

It has been immensely frustrating for me, especially seeing how my spouse is able to figure out ways to get him to feed and I have not.  I don't want to leave her to do all the feedings and I want to have him feed with me.  I can't seem to figure it out. She has also expressed frustration that I haven't been able to feed him. My spouse suggested keeping him vertical, keeping him calm in a certain way, and feeding him at particular moments, but I feel like I have tried all those and it still doesn't work for me.

I'm sort of at my wit's end about it. I am calm when I first start feeding and I get more and more stressed as he just refuses to eat.  I guess I wouldn't feel as bad if we both weren't able to feed him, but (even though I'm glad he eats with someone) it's almost more stressful that I have trouble and my spouse does not.

Anyone have any advice or suggestions?  We use Avent Natural bottles and we have adjusted the flow rate accordingly as he has gotten older.  He has taken to those bottles for a while.  He recently had a checkup and everything seems fine.  We have other bottles, but haven't tried them due to his use of the Avent Naturals."
My 7yr old son won’t go to bed at night. We’ve had this problem for 3 weeks now. Everytime I put him to bed he sits up and cry’s because he hears noises at night. We’ve told him that it’s just the house settling but he thinks there’s ghosts. We’ve bought sound machines and they are not working. It just keeps my son up all night long. My wife and I can’t get any sleep because of this. He will literally sit up and cry for 3 hours straight. What do we do? We’ve even went as far as to put him in a different room but nope he still does the same thing in a different room. He is scared to death and will cry constantly. We don’t know what to do. We can’t have him sleep with us or it will develop as a habit.
"My wife and I separated when she was only two months old. The pregnancy ended up exposing a lot of bad in our relationship, so on and so forth...

Fast forward 10 months, we are in a custody battle which I am slowly but surely winning, which is absolutely wonderful, but we recently had an increase in time that she spends with me and things have started to change for the worst. 

Allow me to preface this by saying that I love her more than anything in the world, and I would do anything for her, so this feels horrible to say.

We have a lot of fun playing together, she's well fed and is developmentally fine. I started to get her for two overnights a week about two months ago and in the last week or so things have gone south for reasons that I don't understand.

She now will not play alone for any longer than two minutes before she starts whining. That whining, if not catered to within a few more minutes will turn into visceral screaming as though she is being decapitated with a butter knife.  Beyond not playing alone, if I don't pick her up constantly she will do the same thing.  But even picking her up isn't enough as she will often crawl all over me crying.  I need time alone sometimes, time to go to the bathroom, or do some work.

Her doctor offered that I should let her cry it out, expressing that, much like a dog, if you continue to give in, you'll continue to support this behavior and that sometimes the best thing to do is to just let her understand intermittently that she is safe, but to otherwise not comply with her request so long as she's in this state.

The problem is, she can cry for a really long time. I mean, I have no idea how she doesn't pass out at some point.  My ex says that she doesn't experience this at all, which makes me feel like I'm the one that has messed up, giving in too frequently.

It really bothers me, forcing me to experience a range of emotions from sadness and abject failure to rage (always electing to walk away). I just want her to be happy.

Has anyone had success with crying it out?  Is she actually old enough to understand that she can behave differently between my ex and I?  What else can I do?"
"Maybe its the lockdown order, but my husband has been home with my daughter who's almost 2 for about a month and he does such an amazing job.

I'm currently pregnant with our 2nd, so maybe I'm just tired or extra judgy of myself. But I feel like he nails the parent thing more then I do sometimes. I guess sometimes I sound ""sharp"" when I truly don't mean too (whether thats short of breath or a badly timed braxton hick) and my patience isn't as cushioned as his. I'm not mean or impatient on purpose. I just feel like he does a better job then me. 

I'm so happy to see their relationship blossoming and I love how she needs her daddy.  And she defiantly runs home to me when I come home and wants mama cuddles  (I'm essential)

&amp;#x200B;

IDK it just makes me wonder if I have this all wrong. That maybe I should be the one working more since he seems to do better then me. The thought makes me sad, but I honestly am looking at my kid and future kiddo and I want them to have the ""better"" parent if that makes sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I adore and love my kids. I'm just trying to look at this with an outsider perspective."
"Apologies in advance for typos etc - on mobile and feeling very emotional. I hope it makes sense.

I'm really at my wit's end. My lovely smiley baby has turned into a monster. These past couple of weeks she's started resisting sleep at night. Initially we thought it was because we'd put a new blackout blind up but this continued after we removed it. She will wake up for a feed and then not go back down. Or sometimes will just not want to sleep. I cuddle her and put her in her crib and she wakes up immediately. I've tried putting her in awake and she rarely self settles. She used to before all this but it's like she's gone backwards. I've brought her in to my bed and she's gone straight to sleep. It's like she needs to be held and/or be close to me. She cried the other day when my husband tried to do it and calmed down when I took her. Other times I'll bring her into bed and it doesn't work. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm currently sat here with ear defenders on trying not to cry because I can't bear her crying. There's nothing wrong with her - she's got a clean bum, she's had milk - yet she just continues to cry. I genuinely don't know what to do next. I feel like such a shitty mum right now. Any advice?"
"I know many, many children are going through a lot right now, and we have followed recommendations to try and be comforting, etc. but it is really becoming a huge problem every night (edit: *since lockdown*) where our daughter will SHRIEK that she's hungry, delay bedtime for HOURS, or wakes up after a few hours and decides she's up for the day (essentially treating bedtimes as naps). It is pretty much nightly, and my husband and I are exhausted. On top of this, I'm very pregnant and very tired.

We have tried different methods including ignoring the screaming, explaining to her (not just at bedtime), laying with her, not laying with her, telling her she won't get to do X if she doesn't rest, telling her she doesn't have to sleep but can play or read quietly in her room, etc. Nothing is working.

One of the big issues is she is constantly saying she is hungry, no matter how much she has eaten - and she eats a LOT, and we've been doing a bedtime snack before her usual milk before bed. We tried not feeding her or giving her milk, we tried giving her a little bit, and I've tried giving her ice chips instead of food, but she will still scream and bawl that she's hungry. Last night she would not sleep until she had 2 full cups of milk. She slept around 11pm. She woke up at 6am, and tonight again it's 9:30 and we started her ""calm down""/pre-bedtime routine at 7:30pm.

She went for a run today, and in the evening we did bubbles and physical activity at home to help her burn energy. She had a big dinner of burger, fries, chocolate milk which finished around 6:30, I think. At 8:05pm she had a bedtime snack of half a fruit crisp, some cashews, and peppermint tea. Then she had a full cup of warm milk. We read a story, brushed her teeth, brought her to bed and once she gets in bed she becomes wild and the insistence of hunger starts again.

I don't want her to get cavities. We repeatedly tell her to eat as much as she can before bed because after brushing her teeth it's bad to eat. She agrees and says she doesn't want cavities. But she will literally stay up and battle us once it's actually bedtime. On top of that, she stops listening. She asked me for a story, and I agreed but only if she laid down. She didn't lay down and just kept repeating she wants a story. So I kept repeating, sure I will read you the story when you lay down. Then she started screaming at me. So I told her during a non-screaming moment if she kept screaming, I would leave, but I'm happy to read a story if she lays down. She continued the screaming, so I left the room.

Then after a few minutes she started crying and screaming saying she was scared and hungry.  My husband and I were like - do we just do this every night because of what's going on? We've spoken to social workers/therapists who are saying to pretty much do what the kids want but it's becoming very exhausting to do it for hours after her bedtime, and the middle of the night, and then having her wake up early.

Our daughter didn't do anything near this before lockdown. She did have issues before bedtime but nothing on this level. She slept by herself and didn't wake up at night except to pee.  Now, she needs someone there, needs milk, etc. There was maybe a week (2 weeks ago?) that her sleep looked like it was getting back to normal then it went back to this crap.

Sorry for the long post.

**Edit:** I think she's asleep now (\~10pm) after the milk and my husband laying with her. This is an upgrade from last night where that was not enough.

**Tl;dr:** 3yo has been a MESS with sleep since lockdown, will literally stay up and demand milk once or twice, and sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night for the day.

Note: she has a sound machine, she has good meals in the day and bedtime snack, she burns energy in the day, she has a 1-2hr nap, and we try comforting and alternate ways of settling her."
"Dear parents out there,

We had our first baby 6 months ago and even though every single day and night have been exhausting for us, we are considering having a second child at some point. 

My wife and I grew up both as only child, always wishing to have siblings, that’s why we don’t want our daughter to experience that. 

From you experience what is the ideal age difference between siblings? And how did having a second child affect your life?

Thank you all in advance, we have been learning a lot from this subreddit."
"My two-year-old is loves music, loves dancing, trying to sing along and demands that I pick her up and spin her around. She also however, is very clear about what she likes and what she doesn’t like. Not just any music will do, though she strongly favors 80’s pop.

This afternoon, she just wanted to snack and watch Blippi after our very limited lockdown-approved outing, which normally would be fine with me but I was having a sudden and extreme Olivia Newton-John attack. I already knew that the little one didn’t like the “Twist of Fate” video, but I imposed my will, stopped Blippi, scooped up my baby and promised she could watch all the Blippi she wanted if we danced for one song. 

Three minutes of a middle-aged dad shamelessly rocking out and spinning his baby around later and... baby relaxed and zonked. 

I always knew it was in part my enthusiasm for the music that got the little one into it, but this was the first time I managed to pour so much energy in that it washed away the baby’s objections."
"My two girls fight like crazy even before ‘rona. Scratching, punching, kicking, sitting on each other, anything you can think of...pulling hair, tripping. They’re 4 and 5. Sometimes they’re best friends. Nothing I’ve tried stops them from fighting. Don’t know what to do. Help. 

I’ve tried- redirecting, separating them, yelling, taking the tv."
"This is long, I'm sorry!

Some backstory to explain the situation and give perspective:

-My 14yr old (grade 9) son failed 2 classes last semester for not doing the work.

-This semester he almost failed a 3rd class for the same reason, but the teacher actually called me this time, gave me all the work and gave my son the opportunity to do the work with docked marks for lateness.

-he has mild autism but no learning disorders and is average intellectually (so no real issues preventing him from doing the work or making the effort other than task management)

-during this period of at-home-learning, his teachers assign work on Monday, it's due on Friday. I've been using a task manager to break up the assignments into 1hour-ish increments per class (total 3-4 hours a day of class) 

-I have FOUR TIMES shown him how to take notes, how to write, how to edit, how to format a paper.

-i have been breaking down each step and given it in his daily task manager, so it's very clear what needs to be done. Those tasks also have subtasks should any further break down be needed.

-i have been editing for him! Writing notes on Google docs with instructions and corrections and having him do the corrections.

The issue:

This child doesn't put effort into anything 😩
More importantly, With the tall management and help with editing, and instruction on how to do things I end up putting as much time into the assignments as him!  With no results in the end!

This week, even AFTER braking down every minute step of a glacier research paper for him, he didn't manage to get it done to an acceptable level. (This is not the first time for this particular class. And it's the same from one of his previous failed classes.)

It's due in 90 minutes. He has nothing that will garner marks to hand in. 

Because rather than researching, he never once read the instructions and instead complained about how unfair having to write a report is. ( it's totally fair and who cares if it's fair??!!)

I told him, that's it! I'm done, I'm not helping you anymore with this assignment. You won't listen, you're talking over me, denying doing anything wrong, refusing to put the effort in, shouting at me, rolling your eyes. 
I'm not helping anymore and you'll have to hand in what you have because you had plenty of time and help to complete it with good results.

So the question: 

Am I wrong for refusing to help anymore with less than 2 hrs to go?
I feel like he deserves a bad mark, he earned it! He should accept the consequences of his bad choices!

But I also think, it's my responsibility as his mom to ensure he gets good grades.

What do you think?"
"First, I love my kids. I have 3,  ages 2, 6, and 10. Currently, all boys.

Second, I had a bad childhood. So bad I have few memories, and the few I have, the happiest are from when I was not at home. My mother was gone (she left) from age 8 and onward.

The rant: 

I hate Mother's day. I hate the fanfare surrounding it. Every year I am inundated with posts about what to do for your mom, what to get your kids to do for their grandma (Grandparents day is the first Sunday in September after Labor day, just saying). And I hate all of it. I don't want to hear Happy mother's day from everyone. There are 4 people I want to hear Happy Mother's day from, my kids and my husband. Even then, I hate hearing those words. Yes I love my kids, but I hate hearing those words.

Saving grace this year is that the kids are home. They don't know what day it is. They don't pay attention to the calendar unless an actual holiday is coming. I don't have to worry about hearing those dreaded words from random people, simply because we're stuck at home. I'm almost looking forward to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else dread mother's day? Despite being the mother? Same question to Fathers, and Father's day."
"My 4 year old has had a queen size bed for a few years now but now that we have our second child who in a few months will be transition to a toddler bed too I was thinking of getting him a twin size bed. He loves his space to stretch I know that, however, both boys have to share this room and the room is kinda small... I’m skeptical about getting him a small bed cause he loves to lounge on this big one. What should I do??? Any mamas with advice about this???"
"I have 2 daughters 2 and 4. My oldest is getting to the age where she wants to play with toys properly, and the little one wants to play with everything.  So for cleaning up her room without me having to tell her for the first time, I promised her a toy. She got a play kitchen. She was putting all the pots and stuff where they belong and in walks 2yo who basically pushes her off and starts playing with the toy and gets mad when 4yo tries to play. I pull her off and she screeches and just goes right back on it even when I try to give her her own toy. She is like this all the time, and I'm just wondering if 2 is a good time to teach sharing and how to go about that. Thanks"
We plan on attempting our first blanket fort this weekend with our toddler. Any tips? I'm thinking of using our cat tower and the paino since I've our low couch between the two on the wall. I have two european king sheets to use. And I found chip bag clips and I'm still looking for the  command strips.
"I remember being rebellious when I was a kid, but I never said anything this hurtful to my parents.

We were arguing over her curfew (it’s 11 PM, I find it reasonable and she doesn’t), and the whole thing escalated until she told me that she’d be happy if I killed myself.

I was shocked when she said it, and I was even more shocked when she showed no remorse. I just walked away, but I went to my bedroom and cried for a while after. I don’t understand. I’ve always had her back and supported her decisions. I’m much more understanding than I think most parents would be. 

I’ve always let her express herself, and I generally let her do whatever she wants (as long as it’s legal). I don’t know what else she wants from me. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety myself, so that comment particularly hurt me. I’m still in shock from it quite honestly.

I’m ashamed to say this, but I’m having trouble forgiving her. I feel like there’s been something broken that can’t be fixed. It’s awful to think, but I just feel differently about her now."
"So, my daughter turned 6 months old yesterday. In celebration, we decided to feed her her very first serving of baby food - peas! She wasn’t sure about them at first, but she caught on fast, and by the time she was finished, she was a huge fan. But, of course, she made a mess - baby food all over her bib and the muslin blanket we were using to try to protect her clothes. No big deal - throw that stuff in the washer with the rest of her clothes. 

IT TURNED EVERYTHING YELLOW.

I asked my mother about this afterwards, and she told me that she’d never had that problem and that it shouldn’t have been an issue. Has this happened to anyone else? How do I fix it? Are we supposed to feed her naked and use paper towels as bibs?? It was just regular Gerber baby food. Her beautiful white blankets all now look like they came from a home where both parents are heavy chain smokers. 😩"
"My daughter is 5 and will be 6 in November. She is my oldest child and I also have a son who will be 4 next month and I am 7 months pregnant with our last child. The problem I am having is it seems like my daughter never left the terrible 2 stage. She is my oldest so I kept saying “oh this must be a phase” but it never went away and I only recently thought that maybe it won’t go away because my 3yo has turned into a mostly respectful child (he makes mistakes occasionally but almost always apologizes and is better for the rest of the day). 

For example, this morning she puts on a shirt out of the dirty hamper that has food smashed into it in multiple places. I tell her that she has to pick something else to wear today because it is dirty. She then starts yelling no at me and that she’s wearing it anyways. She ended up going to time out after this being continuous ( 5 minutes, we do 1 minute per year of age). She comes out of timeout and we have a heart to heart talk about why, etc and she goes to sit down. Then she immediately takes something from her brother to which he starts crying and I ask her to give it back. She starts yelling no at me again and I go to take it from her and she’s pushing and kicking and thrashing. She goes back into time out for 5 minutes. Then while she’s in timeout she starts screaming at her brother that “I get X today and you don’t HAHAHA”. 

Basically this is how my life is 24/7 and it’s starting to affect my sons behavior as well (he mimics her at times and does the same behavior back to her). It’s to the point where she still will hurt her brother and I (hitting on purpose or even just thrashing about when she doesn’t get what she wants). Her school said she is the best behaved child there in her class which honestly completely shocks me. Even asking her to pick up her toys in the living room I basically have to hold her hand and guide her to do it or she won’t. I’ve also caught her telling her brother in his ear to do bad things so he will get into trouble. We have tried multiple discipline strategies, I’ve tried natural consequences, taking things away, time outs, my husband wanted to try spanking which I didn’t really want to but even that didn’t work. So we’ve just resorted to time outs and just trying to talk to her and make her understand why there are rules or why I ask her to do something. 

I also have tried things like positive reinforcement, and I make a conscious effort to give her extra time and attention because I’ve thought well maybe I’m just not giving her the positive attention she needs but it’s not helping either. 

I don’t know if this helps but we have been told she’s gifted. She draws incredibly well (like can draw Minnie Mouse and you will immediately know it’s Minnie Mouse) and is already doing addition and subtraction and has always done well with numbers. 

As soon as this virus is through I have a consultation on standby with her pediatrician but I was just curious if anyone else has gone through this and possibly has any tips? I love her so much and I just want to have the best relationship with her now so she feels supported and loved and won’t have any problems as an adult."
"Decided it would be smart to get a puppy. I’m not too upset because he’s super cute and good BUT my 20 month old daughter keeps trying to sit on him, lifting her leg up to step on him, purposely rolling around on the ground next to him so the puppy play bites her which causes my daughter to cry, which causes her to need assistance from me only to have her five minutes later go back and antagonize the puppy again. She keeps trying to pick him up which leads to my daughter choke-holding him

I’m ready for them to best friends and hoping all the antagonizing she is doing to the puppy just means he’s going to grow up and be a great family dog"

"I denied myself an Oreo and have only eaten toast(although heavily buttered) today. I'm starting to regulate my diet and I have an excersise routine. I'm so proud of this small act of discipline. Thanks for reading.
Edit: oh shit, it's only been a minute, I've got so many comments, at least more than im used to in this time"
"They called me and asked if i wanted to come in friday or saterday for training.
This makes me so happy its my first jib and i tried so hard to get one for sooo long 
This will probably be taken down cause it doesnt ""leave it to an open conversation"" but i just had to share this cause i have little to share it with and this just makes me happy i feel like i finally completed something and did something right for  once. 
Thank you for those few who gave me luck and advice during this"
"18 years of education! All done in one quick moment! I submitted my final assignment, and immediately went to think ""what's next on the agenda?"". Turns out, it's nothing at all!

It's kind of scary. I'm graduating from a film program, and based on the Current Situation, I don't know how easy work will be to come by. I am an editor by trade which may bode well for me, but I hope I can find some kind of consistent work out there!!

Anyone else in a similar position? I want to celebrate all these years, but it just feels weird to me. I've never known anything more than school all year.

Edit: I posted this right before bed! Sorry I didn't respond to many of you but I'll try now!"
I’ve been in quarantine for a verrry long time now and decided to get outside and try to run but I was having an extremely difficult time with it (I’ve never been a good runner). Then a kind woman smiled and waved ‘hello’ from her bike and the sun was warm and bright and everything felt a little less hard. I hope she’s having a good day.
"Just seriously. Most people who comment on posts say nice things. Compliment, sincere questions, the works. Even when there’s the occasional dick, most people will try to uphold the dignity of Reddit and put them back in their place"
"I was unsure about who I was and who I wanted to be all throughout college. I was lazy and my grades suffered. I finally found passion in medicine and science but there were some doubts in my ability to make it into med school due to my past academic mistakes. I put in the effort. Went back to school. And not only did I get into med school, which alone is an amazing accomplishment, but today got a call from my dream school informing me that I was chosen for a scholarship!!! I’m so proud of how much I’ve grown since I was a little scared undergrad. I am so sure of myself and my ability and I can’t wait for what the future has in store :)"
"I worked out for the first time in years today. I have had three pregnancies in three years, and I had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even look in my reflection. I hated the way I looked, so today, I decided I could either hate my body another day or start changing it. I plan to continue because it made me fee good, and I genuinely want to change. If any of you have good beginner workouts, please suggest them!"
"I often will find myself with a facial expression that doesn’t match what’s going on around me, like I’ll be scowling because of an argument I’m having in my head with someone I know, or I will smile because I imagine a scenario that I find amusing or pleasing. 

Sometimes it’s my imagination and sometimes it’s reliving a memory. 

I’m interested to see if I’m the only one that does this, I never catch anyone I know doing this but I know that I’ve been caught several times, and people will give me a weird look. 

I’m gonna go to sleep now but I’ll reply to any comments in the morning.

Edit: thanks for all the replies, glad I’m not the only one who does this"
"I had a date planned the year prior and told myself that if by March 2010 that if things weren’t going to get better, I was done. I picked the date and waited. Things didn’t get better by March so I started planning how.

On the day, my nephew, who was a year old at the time, didn’t want to leave my side. He wanted to be on my lap, wanted me to play with him, made sure that he stuck by my side, no matter how I hard tried to get away from him.

That night, he fell asleep on my lap, hugging me. My sister came in from working all day and commented how unusual it was for him to be cuddly and asked that if anything happened to her, she wanted me to take care of him.

I knew that I couldn’t go through with it. I decided that no matter how rough life was going, I was going to experience it all.

I wish that I could say that the past ten years went by easy. There were times, especially in the beginning, that I wanted to take back the decision and questioned why I still had to go through so many trials. There were times where it felt hopeless but I kept going, not wanting to back down on my decision. I held on to the belief that things will get better.

And they did.

There were so many good things that happened to me in the past ten years that I honestly felt so blessed that I got to experience it. The bad made the good things feel so much sweeter.

Ten years ago, I remembered being so broke that I had to ration a package of hotdogs to last me for a couple of days. Ramen always made me hungrier the next day.

Today, I had hotdogs just because I wanted them.

I always have looked back to where I came from and I am proud of the person I am today because of the experiences that made me stronger.

Keep fighting, keep adapting and be open to new opportunities and possibilities. Just because things are bad now, doesn’t mean that they’re going to be bad forever.

I am still learning, still trying and still open to where life takes me. I can’t wait to see what the next 10 years will bring me"
"For context I’m visually impaired. I do have a guide dog but will occasionally use my white cane(went to Disneyland and put my guide dog in the air conditioned kennel).

I’m one of those people that name everything. My phone has a name and so does my watch. Of course my canes have names as well. My straight cane is Bob and my fold up cane is Stuart- they are my minions they do all the work I get all the glory...plus no one understood why I wanted to name my fold up cane Dr Leo Marvin(if you get it extra points!).

Anyway my youngest niece only knows my canes by the names I’ve given them. If I ask her to get my cane she just stares and is quiet, but if I say “will you go grab Bob for me?” It’s and immediate “okay!” Well in her virtual Kindergarten class last week they were learning about differences and how people look, talk, and are simply different from them. The teacher apparently showed the class a picture of a blind person using a cane and my niece yelled at the top of her lungs “MY AUNT HAS A BOB TOO!” My sister in law called me to tell me this story and to let me know she had to explain to the teacher and the class that I named my cane Bob. That white canes aren’t really called Bob. 

It’s a silly story but made me laugh so hard I cried which is always good to have every once in a while. I hope it brought a smile, a chuckle, or a full blown laugh to your day."
"And for the first time I felt something I never thought I would feel by looking at it: joy.

For the first time ever what seemed to be an impossible task not too long ago, has happened. I have reached $10,000 in my savings, and I felt a happiness looking at that number that I cannot really describe. A mixture of relief and gratitude.  
2 years ago I was eating rice, lentils, and eggs if I was lucky, living paycheck to paycheck planning out every dollar spent. Ex S/O cheated while on vacation, bad parental relationship, squeezed my way into a sublease, and failing out of college. I am ashamed to say I had to pocket a few power bars here and there to get past the monotony of one flavor, but I *never* asked for a handout.   


My life turned around when I pushed to find a better paying job, which led to meeting my  current s/o who is an absolutely incredible and faithful human. I am now on track to graduate (1 year late,  every flower has it's time to blossom) by the end of this spring, and all while working my dream job.  


I just want to tell you all, everyone out there who is a victim of r/narcissisticparents, who want r/financialindependence, who are making a transition from r/teenagers to r/college. It gets better. Life will sure as hell test you. You need to summon the best and worst parts of yourself to get through it, and once you're past that door of maturity and independence, you won't even recognize your past self. In fact, the past will finally be *the past*,  the future will seem less out of reach, and the present will be all the more clearer.  


Sending love and strength out to you all!"
"Hey! I dont wanna seem cheesy or fake, but all of you are amazing people, even though I dont know you. 

Every day we do something fun, some thing we are proud of. We make mistakes and we learn from them. We learn something new. 

Edit: what is something good you did today?

Just wanted to say that! Good day!"
"Hi there. I’m 15F and I’ve struggled with hiding an eating disorder for about 2 years. The real sucky thing is I’ve never been overweight and I’ve also never been underweight. Just normal. And for the longest time, I’ve longed to be bones. The type someone would look at and think I’d need to be in a hospital. It still excites me a little, ngl. 

BUT I’ve been getting better. I have been eating healthy foods, but a lot of it. It’s hard but I know it’s the right thing to do. I used to cry at night and work out a ton and then binge eat and then starve and just repeat over and over and over. It was miserable. Today was the first day I’ve eaten 3 meals, not used a calorie tracker, and only did 30 minutes of exercise in probably 2 years. I feel shaky and nervous and I’m stressed but I did it. I know it’s an uphill battle but I’ve already started climbing and I know it’s the right thing to do. Anyways, I just wanted to let someone, anyone, know because no one irl knows. And if you are struggling with an eating disorder, please find help. Life becomes all about food and it’s the only thing on your mind, the only thing you dream about, and you’re guilty and miserable all the time. Please get help if you need it. 

Thanks for reading :)"
It’s not quite time to celebrate (I still have two online exams left) but I feel so relieved to be done with this paper. I always have a bad feeling before I get my grade back (never had a bad paper grade though) but I’m trying really hard to feel optimistic about this one.
"Have you ever found a topic that interests you and decide to do a quick google search on your phone to find out more information, only to find an article riddled with ads that keeps bouncing you back to the top after every few paragraphs you read? I refuse to read the article after that and it’s super upsetting. I’m hungry for information dang it! And don’t even get me started on the top 10 lists of whatever that make you click “Next” for every item and give you a new ad. Cmon internet. Get it together."
"The above quote has always spoken to me, especially about fitness. I was lucky to have some genetics on my side so I became lazy and blah about my physique. Until recently I decided oh hell naw. I’m not feeling this shape anymore. 

I’m on the beginning of a lifestyle change. I’m two weeks in and realized I should take a couple of “before” photos to make sure I see the progress no matter how small. So my fiancée is on a ft call to his mom in the other room so I go to the washroom (horrible lighting which is the silver lining I’m choosing to hold onto) take off my clothes and prop my phone up to take 4 pics of me. Well, well, well.. just as I expected. I’m chubby lol it definitely wasn’t a mood booster but let’s hear any advice you wish you received sooner or something you would like to share.

I want to feel strong and sexy again! And I’ve estimated 3-6 months to see the changes I want. How long did it take you?? What will it take for you to finally say enough is enough?"
"Honestly the most wholesome thing happened to me a few months ago and it still sits with me now. 

I was getting a train after work to my Fiancé. I don't drive, and I just had a late shift. This woman with a thick accent came up behind me, I saw her at the previous train station, and it seems that she was also switching trains to the one I was getting on. She sat down next to me, and as we both looked up, we saw that our train was delayed. She turned and asked me 

""Are UK trains always this bad?"" And I laughed at that. And we started talking. We probably spoke for an hour, before our train was officially cancelled. And at this point I was freaking out, because I didn't want to wait for another hour, for the next train. This woman phoned her husband, and she offered me a lift home (she lived in the same town as my fiancé) and we just continued chatting the entire way. Her kid, was cute as all hell. Her husband was nerdy, and it was generally the most wholesome and kindest act from a stranger I've ever had. 

I'll never forget that couple. Anyone else had a wholesome experience from a stranger?"
"I don't know. I feel so lonely all the time. It's like I don't belong anywhere. Like I'm just a passenger in life and see it happening in front of me. But like I'm not participating in life at all.  
  
It's like I'm not real or I don't even exist. Like I'm some kind of character who isn't a real person but maybe I'm an alien?  
  
I don't even feel that I'm from this planet. Where am I from? How come I'm so different? I don't feel people. I don't feel like me. I don't know who I am!  
  
Can someone help me? So I don't lose my mind and do something stupid?  
  
Thanks."
"I used to have a LOT of online friends, I was part of so many group chats and spoke to people from all over the world. We met through similar interests in books and music. It's been a few years since I last spoke to most of them, but we still followed each other online. Two of them unfollowed me today and it just made me sad. There's nothing wrong with it of course, it's their choice. But I just feel like I lost someone who was a big part of my life once. I'm glad I'm still in close contact with some of these friends, I hope I don't lose touch with them either. Have you ever lost contact with online friends and felt sad about it?"
"I know every parent thinks they have the perfect child and I am one of them. I never feel comfortable talking too much about it because I don't want to feel like I'm gloating to other parents. She's almost 2 and has just the most wonderful sense of humor, she laughs all day long. We go on daily walks where she is always excited to explore and just play in some dirt. She'll turn over rocks looking for worms, but she's afraid of them lol. While she doesn't like all food, she tries everything. I enjoy going out to eat alone with her, it's actually one of my favorite things. She has no interest in tv all day until right before bed, she'll crawl in my lap and ask to watch some Elmo. Everything about her is just so wonderful. Every night I'm excited to go to sleep because when I wake up I get to spend another day watching her grow up. I'm the luckiest mom in the world."
"She’s the mom of one of my best friends. When I first heard of the meme, I didn’t understand it at first, but then I realized it. 

And as time went on, I realized that the name doesn’t make the Karen; it’s the habits, the haircut, the entitlement and the ever-so-infamous “i wAnT tO sPeAk wItH tHe mAnAgEr”. 

People, I’ve reached enlightenment"
"I am 60. I have had asthma most of my life. Last October I had the most awful respiratory infection of my life. Therefore, I have taken this virus seriously since the beginning.

However, about a week ago, I started having muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath. When my temperature got to 100 degrees, I knew I had to apply for testing. I went in last Friday.

It’s been a very long four days, but I just got my results, and the document clearly states that I do NOT have this evil virus. I am very, very relieved that I won’t have to call my brother and ask him to help me put everything in order for my kids. I’m also glad I will probably have more time with my significant other. This is a good day."
"I'll preface this by saying: I hate eggs. So much. I have a weird thing with textures and consistencies in my mouth, so rubbery, slimy eggs have always been a hated food for me. It's the reason I don't eat cooked peppers but will munch on them raw, and why I can't stand cooked carrots. Squishy grossness right there.

My boyfriend loves eggs, especially runny eggs. And I love cooking so I've learned to make eggs in all sorts of ways. Lately he's been on a boiled egg kick and after a bit of practice I've nailed making soft boiled eggs. He likes to take toast and dip it in the yolk then eat the whites, and he's tried several times to get me to try it but I've always been way too squeamish and set in my ""eggs are the nasty"" ways.

I'm not sure why today was different. Maybe I was just tired of him pestering me to try it. But I tried it today. I just barely dipped a fork into the yolk. Not enough to really taste anything, more to see if the texture was going to put me off. I didn't know eggs could be, well, silky is the closest word I can think of. It wasn't slimy, anyways, so I gave it a real try with a piece of toast. Y'all. It was so good. My mind was blown. My boyfriend laughed at me cause I was visibly surprised by it. I am still mind blown.

My boyfriend let me have the rest of that egg. I still made him eat the yucky whites. But I can now say I like eggs... kinda."
"I feel like I haven’t been doing much with them lately. And it kinda bothers me honestly. Some of it is because I feel both our moods are soured due to covid and their work, but this is one of the longest times I’ve gone without talking to them. Anyone able to relate?"
"My family has 4 dogs at the moment,  2 are mine, 1 is my son's, and 1 is a puppy we are training for my parents. They are 2 1/2, 1 1/2, 11 months, and 4 months.

I just let them out and counted as they went to make sure they all went out as the 11 month old will hold it till he pops rather than go out. When I let them back in, it suddenly occurred to me  that they always go out in the same order

 They go out oldest to youngest. 

Every.  Single.  Time.

This is something they do on their own, and not something we taught them. They come in by who gets there first, but they always go out the same way."
"I know this seems really cheesy and quite frankly dumb to a lot of people, but myself and some friends from across the globe have been working on a Minecraft creative city project for nearly two years, with myself as the spearhead for the project. I have contributed a significant amount (~60% of the city) and am so happy that a childhood dream of having a project showcased has been fulfilled. Not just a simple house like most videos, but an entire city.

I am very happy about all his positive feedback, and since the video, our happy little creative server has grown to 15x the players.

I have been building for 8 years, and this YouTuber, along with Minecraft (I know it's cheesy and I just make up something different when talking to people irl) have gotten me so hooked on architecture and engineering that I have now completed three years of university in architectural engineering."

"Hello.. I just need someone to talk to..

I was stressed from work and I'm mentally not in the right place.

I tried to talk to my parent and friends about it but they mostly replied with ""I've been to much worse"" or ""... have been through worse, how do you think .... feel""

Tbh because of that, I actually dont really share my feelings a lot to them but I'm getting more depressed day by day.

I just need someone to talk to..

"I’m usually not someone who’s really into my birthday.  They’re not bad but I don’t really get into them too much.  I don’t do too much to celebrate and it’s usually fairly low key.  The last birthday I really liked I spent most of the day finishing up a book I really liked. Pretty good but not very festive or celebratory. 

This year is different.  My best friend is really into birthdays and she’s decided to go all out for me and give me a birthday week.  It’s nothing extravagant (which is good cause I would feel kinda weird if it was too much).  So far she’s sent me little videos or small stuff.  They’ve been great.  

Just found out she’s planning a dnd one shot based around one of my favorite bands!  I can’t wait.  It’s nice to be psyched for a birthday and I hope that anyone else who reads this and feels like they dread birthdays gets to have one they enjoy.

What’s made your quarantine unique?  What’s that one story about yourself you love to tell?  How are you holding up right now?  I know none of this is easy for any of us.
"Yet another love casualty of COVID-19. I am sad and angry, but I also feel strangely free. At the end of the day, I’m not going to force anyone to put effort into our relationship if they don’t want to naturally on their own.

But anyway... What is your highlight of the past week??"
"Hi everyone! I’m not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Also sorry if my formatting sucks I’m on mobile. 

So with this whole quarantine situation, I’ve done some introspective thinking and concluded that my biggest flaw is that I am not really self-disciplined at all in most areas of my life. I say most because the one thing that I am disciplined with is money simply because I didn’t grow up very well off so I always had to save just about every penny growing up. So right now I’m 22 and I feel like fixing my discipline problem should be a main priority for me because it will affect me in every aspect of my life. 

I can’t seem to hold a workout routine, a diet, hobbies, or even the simplest of things such as making sure I drink a certain amount of water every day. I will start something, but never see it through. 

Anyway my question is: does anyone have any tips on how to improve my discipline? I’ve tried making checklists for myself every day but that hasn’t really helped because I don’t hold myself accountable. Any tips or constructive thoughts are appreciated!"
"It's a nerds greatest goal.(or at least mine) finally can share one of my hobbies with someone that gets excited about it like I do, so we can be excited together. It's like gaming with the boys,  but the boys are hot."
"Kind of a weird thing to be happy about, but I recently noticed how much I’ve matured in matters of finances. 

As a student who has always needed a part time job to make ends meet, I’ve never really had the finances to splurge. I always wanted the best phone, the best PC for gaming, the best iPad for school, etc. But I live in an expensive city and so I controlled myself. Through the years I saved up and got things that weren’t the best, but we’re definitely usable (mid range or second hand things).  

Recently, I started my first ‘big boy’ job, and before that first pay check I had already planned how I was finally going to treat myself (after taking care of rent and bills of course). But when I finally got the money, I didn’t feel any urge to do so. I thought hard about how all the things I have are completely usable and even “enough” for what I do, and spending 100s of euros didn’t seem as appealing. It’s not that I didn’t want to treat myself anymore, just that I no longer felt that “I wish my stuff was better” feeling. I’m more content now with the things I have. 

I understand a lot of people are having a hard time with money nowadays, and I truly hope we all get through this soon. I wasn’t trying to show off or anything, but I’m just happy how much more accepting I am of my belongings. As long as the things I have are decent, I don’t think I’ll keep wanting new stuff anymore :)"
"I am just so happy. I applied to 5 different universities and I was having anxiety attacks because I thought I wouldn’t get in anywhere. With one click of a button (and $200) I accepted the offer to go to school 6 hours from my current house. I got accepted into two universities so far, but the one I really wanted into let me in and now I begin the next chapter of my life. I’ll be moving on my own and living in a city I’ve only visited twice in my life. This is just so surreal that I’m going away to live in a place so foreign to me. I’m so happy and I thought I’d share. This is a real weight off my shoulders. Despite not having a graduation ceremony this year, I’m glad to start my new life!"
"Today my friend replied to my Instagram story, saying “ngl bro you looking bomb”. I was showing something close to my face, and made an effort to look as masculine as I possible (am trans, so this is a big insecurity of mine). It makes me happy knowing my friend thinks I’m handsome, or as he would say; “bomb”."

"People with transgender are already aware gender dyphoria is a mental illness. Gender identity only exists in the mind afterall. As well as it's their therapists who are telling them transitioning is the only way and it's their therapists who are helping them transition. 

Tl;dr Why tell them to seek therapy when most of them already are under therapy?"
"My fam only consist the 4 of us, parents, me (M27) and my younger sibling (F23). My younger sibling recently got her first job and started working for the sales department in the bank. We all get along pretty well but after she got her first job and started working, she has been slowly changing from the happy little girl to the cold stranger that ""rents"" the room in our house. For the past few months, she often came home late, and never talked or even greet to any of us. She would just shut the door after her dinner and isolate herself everyday and it's still going, only time she came out of her room is to have dinner, bath or to grab some drink from the kitchen.   


I've texted (kinda awkward for me to confront her)  her twice and let her know how does my parents feel about this, and she did mentioned to me what was wrong with it, at first my mom had a tearful argument with her but anyhow my parents did apologized to her about what had been upsetting her. It was fine for a week but then she started to isolate herself again.  I felt very upset about this knowing that my parents is also sad and had no idea what was going on with her. Could this be like some sort of rebellious period for her? Or what did we did wrong that makes her upset? I felt really bad and helpless about her when my mom and dad keeps talking about it when she's not around."

"Sometimes I hate my curiosity, sometimes I can’t live life without knowing one thing, this is why I have a pet peeve of when people don’t tell me something but they mention it, because I have so much curiosity. 
This time I really messed up. I searched something I wasn’t supposed too (by my own limitations), I shouldn’t have, I knew it was bad. But curiosity got the best of me. I will not disclose what it is because I’m trying to get my mind off it, but wow. There’s only so much you can take, I thought I was practically invincible to reacting to this sort of stuff, because after all, I watch LiveLeak all the time. Yeah, I really dun goofed.

Different for days with the daughter here but how do you guys plan out meals every day during this time where everyone is home?"
"Since just before the whole pandemic thing started, I started having trouble getting to sleep at night. I would lay there and start to drift off and then I would get this overwhelming sense of dread and it feels like my heart stops. So then I bolt up in bed and I'm breathing trying to relax. This happens between 4 and a dozen times before I finally am able to pass out.

I've experienced flutters before, I used to have them a lot. Now, instead of flutters, I have heart attacks that put me to sleep.

This past week has been especially rough because I'm not getting to sleep until midnight or later and I wake up at 6:30 for work. I lay down for bed around 9:30-10pm. So it's been stressing me out and I'm reluctant to go get referred to a cardiologist because of the outbreak.

I could just use some chat about anything. Feel free to tell me about your day. What amazing or sad thing happened. Tell me your favorite color. Your opinion on something. I’m down to hear it all."
"I live in India. For those of you who do not know, most states in India have their own language. I am from the state of Kerala, where the local language is malayalam.

When I was 14, I went on a trip to Hyderabad with my parents. While we were in a cab, the driver had the FM radio playing and a song caught my attention. It was a Telugu (local language in Hyderabad) song. I couldn't really catch the lyrics because of the language but the tune was really nice. The song ended and I forgot about it soon after.

Fast forward 4 years, I joined college in the state of Tamil Nadu. A few months into college, I had become friends with a few people, and one of them was from Hyderabad. While we were talking about his hometown, I suddenly remembered listening to this song.

So I said ""Hey there's this Telugu song I heard long back, I remember the tune of one of the lines, see if you recognize it"" and sang that tune. He recognized it instantly. I couldn't believe it. He played it on YouTube and I had a face of disbelief all the while the song played. It was beautiful."

"I've been a nurse for 9 years. I'm a little burned out of the field. Honestly, I don't like that many facilities are moving towards being open 7 days a week. Yes, that's great for patients but after spending the last 15 years working weekends and finally getting a job that I don't have too, I don't want to go back to it. I'm at a crossroads, I just had a baby and was excepted into a highly respected Nurse Practitioner program.

Should I go back to school to become nurse practitioner? Pros- make good money, enjoy the career, negative- bad hours, costly program and I'm unsure what the job market for NP's will be in the near future. 

Should I quit my job and be stay at home mom- Dream job but won't make any money and be stuck living in our shitty house. It would allow me to go back to school (if I decide to go back)

Change careers- Job market sucks right now but I'm open to ideas. I have thought about becoming a librarian or even going back to waiting tables.

Continue my current job as an RN: They are going to start making us work more hours and will not reduce my current hours so I can go back to school. They are going to start making us work longer shift and weekends. But I love my coworkers, the job itself and the benefits"

Time to get in shape, be healthy (mentally and physically), and most importantly stop and smell the roses. Well, I’ve been eating a lot of junk food, not working out, crying, and just watching tv all day, and some days I just stay in bed all day. But yesterday I decided that it wasn’t to late to be snacc. I went for a run, worked out, and ate healthily (personally the hard part is the eating). Then I started painting and ordered stuff to dye my hair blonde and some new pretty makeup :) I hope it’s not too late to change my ways and become healthier.

"So yeah, just turned 26 and I am at a weird spot in life. I have been putting a lot of my efforts into building a company from scratch since last 5 years (since I graduated) and I have failed twice already. 

Decided to take a break and to get a Masters Degree from abroad but then Corona happened. So, here I am, sitting alone in my room. Not sure what my future holds and would I be able to lead a life which is not full of stress.

Not going to lie, trying to build a company is fun. Talking to a hundred people everyday, hiring a few of them, motivating them to perform better, trying to build a cash flow stream to support my startup are a few things I absolutely love, but it all comes at a price. Uncertainty is a bitch and I do not want to get old worrying about my next months budget, am I gonna be able to pay my interns, am I gonna need to evacuate my room. The stress that comes with the joy has taken a toll on me and I feel lost.

It still was okay till I was 25. I felt I am young, this is the age to hustle, this is my time. All of a sudden, it does not feel the same. I feel like I just have 4 years and I am going to be a 30 years old man with no significant achievements. All that stress, all those sleepless nights for what?

Has anyone felt so lost at this age? I want to do a lot but at the same time I also feel like doing nothing anymore. I want to build a company but at the same time I want to settle down for a stable job that could get me some peace and stability. 

At 18 I thought I was going to be a well settled individual by the age of 26, a mature person who would understand life, but here I am. I still feel like an 18 years old guy but with 8 years of experience of real life where I had to earn my own bread."
"Hi, guys!
Thank-you for choosing to read this random rant 💜

Okay, so I'm this conservative and awkward girl when it comes to friendships, whether it be new or old. I'd rather make friends with animals than humans. It takes me really long to develop a certain level of friendship with people. So, my way of making friends with someone is me being really, genuinely, nice to them 🤷

I was attending this dance practice meet with this community of people who I've been familiar with for a while now.

Fast forward, we were on our first break after hours of practice, and we were in a small shop to buy food and refreshments. There was a girl who wanted to buy a certain drink, but had forgotten to bring her wallet, so I bought her one. And went on to ask other girls whether they wanted anything to drink. They didn't seem to hear me. So, I asked them again after a while (natural, right?).

They didn't hear me again, but this time there was this other girl who was observing me and she goes ""Why are you being so sweet? They can buy the drinks if they want to 😅"" and seemed to be really weirded out by me being sweet (???). So I told her that I'm asking because they're my friends and that I would buy her one too, if she wanted. And then she seemed to make fun of me for being nice?

After this, I've stopped wanting to being nice. People like her really spoil the happiness you get when you're sweet to someone :/

What was so wrong with me being nice and trying to make friends with humans?

Thanks for your replies, in advance!❤️"

My current way of dealing with it is singing until I forget, it kind of works, I forget for a while, then : BAM! Remember that time you said this thing to someone who probably doesn't remember? Well they do! And they are judging you right now!

I'm bad at confronting uncomfortable thoughts, I actually have a desorder with this particular symptom. People who have that desorder will avoid uncomfortable feelings at all costs. I've had therapy about that, and my life is better. So I'm not sure if my issue dealing with awkward memories is specific to my history, and the fact I never comfronted them for 20 years, or if it happens to everyone. Do you also experience that?

I had an idea how to exorcise myself of these thoughts, and take them out of my head. I thought I could make comics, called something like ""awkward moments"" or ""times I f*cked up"" and just draw those events. Take time to dive in them, and maybe tame them, so that they don't have the power to make me feel bad.

I would also love to hear about your awkward moments, however small they are! I feel like we tend to make mountains out of small things, maybe your mountains are my hills, and my mountains are your hills. Sharing would be fun!


Thank you so much for taking the time to read all that, I wish you love and comfort &lt;3

"I talk with a lot of people from customer service/support over the phone and at some point, I was hit with the realization that a lot of time they have to deal with some nasty customers that can ruin their day. I'm don't remember exactly when I've started doing this but whenever I'm being asked something along the lines with ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?"", I ended up replying with ""Just to have a nice day!""

It may not be much and it takes less than 3 seconds but 2/3 times I get the other person chuckle or at least hear it in their voice that they start smiling and It's making me feel great that I made someone smile.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?"
"I would go with six feet under. Truly changed my
perspective on life and death in general and one of the only series EVER, in my opinion, to perfect the final sequence of the series in the final scene.

"For thought, consider the possibility that the following is true. 

There are multiple realities/universes. 

When you make a decision, reality branches into another “world line,” as some may say, and that other you now exists in a different version of the universe. Or maybe you do? Was a new world line suddenly created, or did it always exist?

If there are multiple dimensions and infinite realities, then there may be infinite versions of you existing on infinite timelines. 

Now, this is where my thought comes in. Assuming free will (let's define it as complete agency) exists, maybe from birth every possible world line exists in a sort of quantum state of uncertainty. And as we live our lives and use our free will to make decisions, we “observe” those world lines. All the other world lines are like Schrodinger's cat. They both do and do not exist at the same time, and it’s only when we observe them that they become real. Even if free will doesn’t exist, it’s still possible that those infinite world lines exist. In that case, we’d just be locked into one."
"I feel like being this excited over furniture means I’ve finally reached adulthood. Up until today, I was still rocking pink and purple bedroom walls from the 4th grade... now I have a big girl room in the shade of gray.

"This year I moved away to another city for university and I've been living in a hall of residence since mid-February. Almost instantly made a great group of friends, life was great. 5 or 6 weeks in of course the country went into full lockdown. Probably 60 percent of my hall went home and the rest of us were stuck in small bubbles. Quarantine wasn't so bad. I had a few of my friends in my bubble, one of whom I somehow ended up dating during the lockdown. But they all went home a couple weeks ago when our lockdown got slightly less strict. My other friends are all still here but they're in different bubbles so sometimes I pass by them from a distance or yell at them but that's as close as we can get. Right now uni isn't as fun as I was hoping for.

But at midnight quarantine lifts. There's still a lot of restrictions but we no longer have to stick to our bubbles. My friend who lives directly below me and I are gonna have a hug for the first time since March at midnight tonight. And my friends who left will be coming back this weekend. Our friend group is gonna have a (small) piss up together. I might even take a roadtrip with a friend to my home city so I can play Mario party with my friends from high school (before they all head back to different universities) and see my cat. I think if I go I won't tell my family I'm coming and just surprise them with a knock on the door. I haven't seen them in 3 months which is a long time when you've lived at home all your life.

I'm not sure what the point of saying all this is. I'm just really, really excited for the rest of the week for the first time in a while. I'm so proud of how well my country's done with this virus so far and hope everyone else around the world eventually gets to feel what I'm feeling.

What is everyone else excited for once you're free again?"
"I am kinda sad right now. I am listening to the song sleep walk, by Santo and Johnny. It's so beautiful. Like minor and major at the same time.

There are no other teenagers I know that like this kind of music, or just the general vibe. I like 50s-80s music a lot, specifically Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd, The Beatles... All well known bands, but my friends all listen to other music... I am not mad at them, just sad... When I listen to No Quarter or Wish you were here I think of occasions these songs would fit perfectly in... Or Drowse, by Queen.. Sunday afternoon, blazing, chilling... But those thoughts are just in my head. When I show these songs to my friends they don't like them. I read the comments of those videos, old people telling stories.. makes me nostalgic of times I didn't live in.

Yeah..

"So after 7 weeks being laid off, I received the call to start back at work next week. But.. I have been moved to a different/ less desirable shift permanently and my current position has been eliminated. I know I should be grateful that I still have employment, but I can't help but feel like I'm being screwed over hard. I've been doing this job for many years now and have positional seniority over others, but they've somehow managed to keep their respective positions. I'm not even comfortable with going back yet. There's no way that social distancing can happen there."

"So, a lot of people tell me i'm a homebody. I am on the introvert side so I guess I understand their point of view. However, I'm not sure why I am considered this. I socialize, go to school, will be starting an internship soon, and just do random stuff outside of the home. I'm a generally grounded person, when I go out I don't stay till late, and my days vary. Sometimes I can be out all day, sometimes I stay home, it depends on my mood and social battery. What I don't generally do is go out clubbing until the wee hours of the morning. So I'm thinking, do they consider me a homebody because I don't generally go out at night? If that's the case, it's the most absurd thing ever. If I don't like to go out at night every weekend so what? Why do I get made of fun because of that? Another thing is that there is nothing wrong with being a homebody as long as you enjoy being one. If you like to be cozy in your own home, that is fine. Why does society put so much pressure for us to go out and pretend to be living in a fantasy world of adventure? I suppose the answer is social media. It just really angers me when people assume things about me and talk to me like that, when in return, I don't really give a shit what others do? If you want to do X do it, if you want to do that do it. Who cares? As long as you're happy and not bothering others, there's nothing wrong with it. People need to step off their moral high ground and righteousness. This is sort of a rant mixed with a question. Thanks for taking the time to read this :)"
"So, we’re a small manufacturing company, located in SoCal. We were allowed to go back to work from Friday. One of my co-workers came in, and is coughing non-stop since yesterday. We asked her to stay home, in case she has anything, and she just ignores all of us. We have older coworkers, with serious medical conditions. My boss offered her to pay her, if she works remotely, she said she’s feeling fine and ignored his request to stay home. What should I do? Any advise?"
"It's a silly habbit of mine to make playlists for every month with bands and artists I didn't know of. So basically my memories of now would be associated to these songs and when I listen to them sometime in the future, they remind me of the current present. I know, it's a pretty confusing thing and I'm pretty dumb at explaining things, so you might have not understood it either.

But what I need from you now is, list your 5 most favorite songs of all time and I'll add them to my Playlist! The genre, language, artist, nothing matters, I'm cool with discovering all kinds of music. Sorry if I come out pretty dumb, I didn't know where else to ask and you guys are pretty friendly. Thanks a lot! : )"
"If I had more time in the mornings, I would start of by doing some yoga. I feel like it would relax my mind, and get a less stressfull start to the day. Then I could maybe take my dog for a quick walk. I'm sure that would get my appetite up aswell. Then I would have time to cook myself a healthy delisious breakfast. Maybe I should just get up 30 minutes earlier? That's hard cause I always stay up so late doing nothing."
"For example, I just realised that in spite of being 24 now, in my head I am still 20. When I think of 8 years ago I still think oh yeah I was like 12 then but in reality I most definitely was not! I think I know the reason for this but I’d like to see if anyone else does this! How old are you in reality and how old are you in your head, are they the same or different?

EDIT: Why do you think you’re still that particular age in your head? Was it something that happened during that point in your life?"
"I guess reading the title will make people think (how the eff do you do that accidentally?!)    
Well, I’m a “key worker” (a carer that works with adults with autism) and I work night shifts. It’s only down to the mad rise in hours I’ve worked since the lockdown and the change in routine. I stopped drinking coffee out of laziness because obviously I never drink it in the morning when I need to sleep and it’s not really a night time drink for me. The sugar is mainly what I added to my coffee (sugar or honey) plus the biscuit or chocolate that I’d have with it.    
I felt like absolute hell for a week or so and put it down to working too much. But then feeling like hell tapered off to feeling, normal?    
It was only when I realised that my coffee beans were still there untouched that it dawned on me.    
It seems so stupid because I didn’t set a target or intend for it to happen but once I found out it made me so damn happy!
Next up, nicotine you little snake."
"We need to share some positivity! No matter how small, what’s one thing you’re proud of today? 

For me, I’d say that it’s my final grade in my Music &amp; Political Action class. I slacked off and missed my first test, starting the semester off with a big fat “F”. I threw my ass into gear and worked hard on every assignment after, and finished out today with an “A-“!"
"I've made friends and we've made our own little community where we all want to have fun and include anyone and everyone who wants to join in. Belonging somewhere and working towards a common goal side by side give days a lot more to look forward to since lockdowns began. I hope everyone finds their places and happiness, every single one of us deserves it."
"I feel like I'm slowly realizing more how unlearned I am. And I think that's the reason I feel kind of like a failure. I'm feeling like I'm bad at my skills.

It's mostly that I have a hobby which I enjoy and want to get really better at, or even a hobby that I'm doing for a long time already, but I'm feeling overwhelmed and / or underwhelmed what I should do about it. And when i get to it motivated and start doing it it frustrates me pretty fast. Probably because I got no plan how to get better or what to do.

But when I do a plan and I follow it, which gives me a good direction, I don't feel like im improving in the long run. And then it falls apart and I'm falling back to doing just something or mostly nothing regarding that hobby.

Another problem is, that I get into stuff like really easily and I want to learn it. Then I'm informing myself how to do it forever instead of just doing it. Maybe because I what to find the best possible way to learn it.

Then you see all the people on social media who are just like so much better st you (in a specific skill) and you start to imagine the amount of work they put in and I get frustrated that I didn't put in the work all the last years. But I don't start putting in the work.

Hobbies affected for those that are interested: Music: mostly Drumming, Music making, playing the piano
Sports: Calisthenics, Bouldering, (wanted to do tricking forever)
IT (also job): programming, networks, cyber security

TL;DR I'm struggling with my self worth and want to change that.

I pretty sure there are some people that feel the same, how do you deal with it? 

Did someone overcome this habits / patterns? What did you do about it?

Does someone have any tips how I could approach to change this?

Are you struggling with a different problem with the things you want to do? What is hindering you to do your hobby / get better at it?

I hope this is somehow understandable and not to big of a mess. Sorry for the long text, maybe it's to deep for this sub. Should i post it elsewhere?

Thank you for taking time and reading, maybe we can have a good talk.

I hope you are super well and i wish you a beautiful day / night. Be blessed."

"I lost the first real love of my life, 12 years ago today. It was an accident, a one in a million occurrence. Still, it happened to us. 

He was 27, incredibly healthy and fit (a semi-competitive middle distance runner), hilarious, intelligent and just starting to figure out his life. 

Everything changed, after that. I'm grateful for it- I've found inner strength I never knew I had. I'm now married to another incredible person, 10 years together and six married. 

It occurs to me that many of us have suffered major blows relatively early in life. I want to send you all a lot of love and let you know I'm in awe of your strength. 

How are you all doing? I'm sure so many of you have stories that will move and inspire me, and others."

"And always, really. I’m not usually one to make an announcement about, or even be proud about, a small gain or small effort, but these days with everything being such a challenge I’m realizing it’s really ok to be happy with yourself that you did get out of bed and get dressed. It really is. 

To deny that and pass it off as an “of course” really serves no purpose. I mean, sure, maybe it’s often easy to get out of bed even if today it isn’t, but are we not allowed to be happy with ourselves when we do easy things? Can we not just have a little moment of “yup, doing ok today” for small things? If we reserve pride for the huge accomplishments, we deny the daily happinesses, and those keep us going. Or keep me going. Maybe. 

So today I’m going to feel good about the fact that I made breakfast and did some stretching, and that I’m going to run my necessary errand rather than laying here and putting it off. And I celebrate you and your small wins, because they add up. 

Tell me, what did you do today that you’d normally feel is an “of course” but that now you’d like to have a mild brag about? Did you shower? Put on clothes? Clean your dishes?"

"Reddit is incredible. I realise that now, over a year and 3 months after I managed to stumble across this amazing app/website. My life hasn’t always been great, I’ve had highs and lows, but Reddit is something I've been able to open and immediately feel better about myself. One post, one silly meme or askreddit can get upvotes, and even if there's only about 3, that's 3 people who enjoyed my post, who notice me! That is an incredible thing. Reddit is the only social media where I've been able to find people like me, and even if they're not like me, people who are fair and just and who judge posts not based on who made them, but by what the post actually was. It is the most kind, most breathtaking (yes, I know, Keanu Reeves haha) community ever. I've never seen so many people reaching out for help getting the help they need from random strangers who care about them. It's just… wow.  
Sorry for the long post, but I needed to say this. I don't care if no-one sees this, because I finally managed to let this out and I'll feel proud that I put this on the internet.  
Thank you for making the last (over) 1 year and 3 months the best of my life. I couldn’t thank you enough."

"TL;DR 
I decided to learn ukulele! I’m developing old hobbies and learning new ones with my quarantine time. Is there something you want to learn? What is holding you back at the moment??

I was always a band geek. My music teacher in 4th grade was amazing and then my music teacher in 5-12th grade was phenomenal. At the end of 3rd grade I was in the process of being removed from my mothers care and adopted by my grandparents. It was a stressful and a strange time for me. Full of shit I didn’t understand. I fell into music kind of as an escape and therapy. Band was my favorite class of the day and was typically a soothing hour for me. A wonderful follow up to the stress of Chemistry. 

Anyways, I know(knew) how to read sheet music. I know how to recreate what someone composed however I’ve never written a song of my own. So for the past two years with writing music at the forefront of my mind, I’ve been trying to decide what instrument I wanted to learn. I recently decided I was going to order a ukulele! I ordered it and now it’s here! I am pretty excited to start writing my own music. 

If I wasn’t under a stay-at-home order, I am not sure if I would have made a decision and took the leap. As much as I thought I would hate it, I’ve come to realize that this is my normal life anyways. I go shopping once a week instead of every three days now, and I explore my hobbies more. I have started exploring NEW hobbies. I am happy with the way I’ve decided to spend my time during this pandemic. 

Is there something you want to learn? What is holding you back at the moment??"

"I'm currently in my favorite job yet. It's part time and unrelated to my career but is outdoors, working with people and had good coworkers. It's social, everyone gets along, and I'm physically tired so I stay in shape. What was your best job, and why did you enjoy it?"
"Today I was lined up at the grocery store, headphones in listening to a lecture when this man queued up with a friend and said something. Assuming he wanted me to make room or was talking to his friend, I stepped aside. But then he tapped me on the shoulder and tugged on my headphones. So, I took my headphones out thinking maybe something happened.

“Theyre going really slow huh?” 

I was kind of confused… like, why would you need to tell me that? 

He repeated it louder so I just replied with “oh theyre really busy” and put my headphones back in.

But he taps me on the shoulder again to say “you don’t like making conversation, do you?” and turns to his friend to say “she’s thinks she's busy”, and then goes on about young people being rude.

Meanwhile I’m just smiling, willing to go next (thankfully I did). 

Its so dumb that Im worried I was rude but I know I wasn’t. And, nothing happened for me to make a scene, not that I would since he's older and it's in public. I almost prefer outright hostile interactions to these kind of exchanges because at least I know where I stand. 

What do you say when no one was actually rude but they were in your space?"
"Because of everything thats going on in the world the past two months have been difficult, but blissful in a way. Where im living, like majority of places, non-essential places are closed and there is not much to do outside the house. At first this lockdown was kind of a nightmare... I had to finish my 1st semester of my certificate program online, couldnt really make plans to go out &amp; my gym shut down... I was basically stuck at home. I am the type of person who likes to be out and about, whether it be out with friends or alone, so this was a big adjustment. 

I just wanted to say im thankful for the last two months. I began to appreciate my own solitude and worry about me. Right now I am a 23 y/o female who is unemployed, lives at home, but still in school, and honestly im not mad at my situation. These past two months I have done things I wouldnt have done prior to this time like:

1) I've read 3 books in their entirety within a month.... This may not be a big deal but considering that I only read a total of 2 books in 2019, this is a HUGE improvement lol. 

2)I learned to skateboard and found a fun new hobby (Kind obsessed lmao) 

3) Ive actually cut down on smoking weed... which is ironic since I have more time to do it now, but I feel good 

4) Staying up late with no worries of the next morning... Sleeping in &amp; NO ALARM CLOCK!

5) Done WAY more self-reflection in order to help me heal and grow 

6) Go on walks almost everyday with my music. This is my favourite thing to do!!! I walk and listen to albums. I have so much fun doing this cause sometimes I feel I dont really appreciate the artist and their creation. My walks have made me realize how much I really love music and how lost I would be without it. My walks are when I can just think about anything or feel whatever.. sometimes if im having a bad day I will even cry and it sounds so bizarre but its just a cathartic feeling 

Sometimes I do feel useless as shit! Im fkn 23 I should be waking up at 8am attending zoom meetings with employers or working from home or working on becoming an entrepreneur to keep up in todays gig economy. But at the same time I think about it and go ""When will I ever get time like this again?"". Im learning to not beat myself up on things I cant control and to also just take a step back. I think we get sooo caught up in comparing our lives to each other that we feel guilty for doing nothing. Im not saying drop your priorities, but during such a unique time dont feel bad for taking it easy. Im learning alot about myself and the type of person I want to become. I still got alot of shit to work on but I feel like im really improving and liking what im becoming. So fuck feeling unproductive or useless or worthless during such a WEIRD AND UNEXPECTED time. If you wanna lay in bed all day do it! Eat junk food? go for it. Skip a home workout cause you just dont want too, fuck it. Take this time to just do whatever you feel is right or will make you happy. Who knows if we will ever get time like this ever again

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I like to ramble and just wanted to share my time during quarantine and I would LOVE to hear what you guys are doing or feeling during this period :)"
"So today I received an unexpected package from Amazon. I had not ordered anything recently so I was skeptical about it. I opened it and found this book: To give Himself Time by Bradford Pratt. I checked my bank account and found a charge from Amazon of $200USD!!!! I quickly went to my account and found no recent orders. Looked up the book and it shows I bought it last week. So I went ahead and changed my password, I kept sending the code to my Gmail but I wouldn't receive anything. So I checked on my ""blocked"" lists and there it was, 'Amazon.com' was being filtered out. I quickly changed all of my passwords and cancelled my Prime and removed my debit card. So now I'll be returning this mystery book, which I have no idea who ordered it. Who placed Amazon on my block addresses on my Gmail, and who is this unknown author. 

If anyone has anything that could help me or a similar story. Please let me know."
"The last few weeks have been kinda rough, as it may have been for a lot of people in lockdown. And I have been thinking a lot, just reflecting on life. And I had this one dream a few days ago and I can't get it out of my head. It was such a sweet dream and the details are all still there.. It was almost like I was years ahead in my life and I was happy, I was married, I had my career, like things just worked out? It just felt so real and idk? Its kinda like everything has been going wrong. I lost my job, my dad is sick with the virus and my boyfriend is away. And then this one dream just changed my mood? Like I feel more hopeful and alive, more motivated and active. I want to get things done, I want to talk to people, I want to work myself to get to where I was in my dream.

I guess I just feel positivity growing in me now and needed to share it lol. 

Has anything motivated you to keep going through this lockdown? Even the smallest of things?"
"Just wanted a small piece for my desk that would make me smile whenever my eyes landed upon it.

Hadn't bought some in a little while; there weren't any pieces that had caught my eye - I buy Star Wars and Avengers sets mainly. A lot of my stuff, including the Millenium Falcon, are boxed up until I have a bit more space to display it all properly.

Once I started building this set, I remembered how wonderfully absorbing the whole process is. From beginning to end, you wouldn't have been able to distract me in any way.

Now I find myself on the LEGO website, planning my next purchase. It'll more than likely be the Razor Crest from 'The Mandalorian'. Not cheap but good fun never is, right?

Anyone else a LEGO builder/collector?"

But I would be lying if I said it didn't make me a little insecure. But I've just been a little bolder these days and I go out of my way to tell her that I like spending time with her, and that I miss her after a while apart.

"So, last week the Lyrid meteor showers were happening and for some reason they were all over my news section. I got really excited about it and was telling my mother all about it. But I realised that I would have to wake up at 4 am to catch them. As someone who loves her sleep, I was doubtful of ever waking up at that time, but I set an alarm nonetheless.

When I woke up to switch off my alarm the next morning, I saw my mum waiting for me to get up so she could go up to the roof with me. It took me a while to realise (because silly me passed it off as a dream), but I sprang up when I realised. 

We then went and watched the meteors together, and it was mostly just flashes of light here and there (damn all the city lights) but it was truly worth it.

"Long story short, my brain just doesn't produce the chemicals needed for, well, emotions. Happiness, stress, anger, sadness? I get a small hint of them, but then its just gone. I've been unable to develop meaningful relationships with peers, and I just don't simply feel attached to or love my family like you feel. But there was this girl in freshman year of high school that, despite my inability to show real, genuine affection, loved me unconditionally. The love I feel for her may not be what she planned for, it may not be the fantastic romantic experience we all expect, but I do my best to show what I can. It's just hard for me is all.

But today, 6 years after I met that girl? My daughter, Elyza, was born into this world. I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I'm smiling, and I'm so fucking excited I'm making a post about it. I feel happy. Real, genuine happiness. I've had this feeling before, but either dulled or had the quick replacement of nothing shortly after. But I'm STILL happy, hours later.

My family went on vacation to the Upper Peninsula. It had been awhile since we went camping, so I was pretty excited. There’s a lot of cool sights to see, trails to hike, and places to visit.

My dad and I ended up going out on our own one day. We planned to go to a museum that was close to a harbor, but the museum was closed. We decided to just walk around the docks of the harbor and enjoy the scenery.

We were walking down a boardwalk, and a duck flies over and lands in the water next to us. My dad and I stop to admire it.

A few seconds in and the duck proceeds to take a nasty shit in the water. 

“Okay that was a little gross, but he’s still cute”

That event pops into my head from time to time and puts a smile on my face. What kind of funny memories do you guys have?"
"Those moments that made you the most happy are priceless. Mine are:

(1) My first kiss

(2) Getting my college degree

(3) My first salary.

What were your best moments in life that you would like to share?"
"It is fairly clear and sunny outside, I have a bit of school work and I might go fishing later. How's your day? Good or bad? Chaotic or peaceful? I'm willing to talk. Ask me a question, tell me a story, or your favourite song. Anything at all."

"It's nothing huge in the grand scheme of things, but it's big to me.  I've always struggled with anxiety and depression pretty bad. Sometime in my teenage years after lots of therapy, it was decided that it would probably be best to put me on antidepressants. They targeted both the morbid depression and the terrible anxiety I was experiencing.  I've tried to get off of them a few times, but I always had a lot of difficulty because I wasn't in a stable situation and I wasn't physically healthy, so withdrawal symptoms from medicine were too much for my body to handle. 


Well, about five months ago I decided it was /really/ time. I weened off, and I've been off of them for about four months now.  I know that seems like awhile ago, but I think the length of time I've been off them is important. It means they're fully out of my system, and it also feels like this might be it. I don't think I'll need them anymore. 

 I have had some of the hardest months of my life recently. Filled with people deaths, pet deaths, career changes, financial uncertainties, and all other sorts of bad luck (not even counting the international tragedies that we're all facing).  During this, I haven't felt nearly as depressed or anxious as I had when I began the medicines.  I'm coping well.  I can recognize the difference between just being sad because of a situation, and me slipping into a depressive episode. And for the first time in my life I can effectively pull myself out of the episodes, or at the very least not let them suck me completely under. 


 I haven't felt suicidal at all, not even when I was weening off the meds (a symptom I'd experienced before when trying to stop them in the past). 


I really hope I'm right and I don't ever have to be on them again.  I have physical things to deal with that mean I'll be on some type of medicine for the rest of my life, but the less medicine I have to take the better.  They were good for my brain at the time. They evened my thoughts out and made life liveable during a time that I didn't want to live.  They definitely saved me.  If I do have to go back on them at some point, for any reason, then that's okay.  I understand our mental health changes throughout our lives, and sometimes medicine is needed for mental ailments just like for physical ailments.  But for now, I don't need it.  And I'm so proud that I've made the progress to be in this position now! 

Thank you for reading, and remember to celebrate the ""little"" things.  Have a good one! :)"

Tonight I've decided to hang around the house with the lights actually on for the first time in probably over a year.

"I’ve been hearing all about the people panic buying and have seen the empty shelves... More than once I have gone to the store to get something and they have been all out.

However, I simply groaned internally, and changed the menu plan or whatever.

BUT...

This past weekend our chest freezer died (we have had it for years, so I should have expected it) so I started looking online and called every place that sells them, within 50miles if us. EVERY SINGLE PLACE WAS SOLD OUT. I was furious, and desperate. I just gave birth a couple weeks ago, and had freezer meals ready for the family, I (can and) freeze fruits and vegetables, make freezer jam, and like to stock up on things when there is a sale, we also bought 1/4 cow about a year ago.

All my preparation and hard work destroyed. When I tried to call/ buy another, I was treated like crud and like I was just another pandemic hoarder, and actually had companies hang up on me! This is hugely just a venting post, but I’m curious what other things relating to the pandemic have set you over the edge?"

"I studied day and night for my college calculus 2 final, far more than I did for all my other finals combined, and I still scored below the class average. Thankfully I passed that class along with all my others but still, I have to wonder if as I'm getting older (I'm 23) I'm slowing down and losing my intelligence bit by bit while others fly me by. It concerns me a bit."
"It's a lonely time, I can definitely feel like I can do something to reduce my own loneliness and others'. So I made a goal to myself that I'm gonna talk to people with no one to talk to (this subreddit and discord)right before I sleep so at least I did something useful while I'm just thinking about my own depression, over the last month or so it's been great to listen to random stories from random people on reddit, sometimes those stories really made my day and I knew that I did something right.

I always think I'm just a line of text away from helping a person out of depression, brighten their day a tad bit, maybe I can make some friend along the way.

And it generally made me felt much better about myself, even though the conversation often never lasted long.

"For the life of me, I can’t finish a single book. I’ll spend so much time reading a new book and as it comes closer to the end, I’ll just abandon it and lose interest. This is with most books I read, whether it be thriller, drama, fiction, non-fiction etc.

"About 10 years ago, my home (well parents home, still live at home...) got hit by a heavy hail storm in Melbourne, Australia.

We had leaks in the roof, that got into our ducted heating and various other places. This caused us to not be able to use the ducted heating, leaving us with no heating at all in the house. For info, our house is a typical 2.5 story hills home (lower story is 2 levels with 5 steps between them!).

The insurance company kept ignoring or forgetting about us, initially due to the brissy floods 10 years ago and other events or disasters that followed. Eventually we had reverse cycle aircons put into my parents room and the kitchen, which also helped heat my bedroom. The rest of the house, including my office, remained without heat... I've used a tiny fan heater for about 5 years to heat my office, before that i just dressed as watm as i could.

But after 10 years, and my parents fightung the insurance company, we had our ducted heating replaced, and two more reverse cycle aircons put in downstairs, giving us heat in the whole house again! It's so nice to be warm again!

We still have more that needs fixing, like our bathroom that has mold all through the walls (no wonder i get such bad hayfever in autumn/spring, that sometimes results in pneumonia!), but this is such a good step forward. We can finally be warm again!"
"So a long time ago, life begun on this planet and then humans came. We just appeared here, we were completely clueless about our existence. What are we even supposed to do?

Humans didn't come with any instruction manual, doesn't that make our existence meaningless? Why should anything matter?

"I was talking to my friend about how doctors lack time to clarify medical topics for patients during the allotted interviews.   
So I thought I would ask what you think doctors miss out on explaining? Also if there is anything you ever wondered about concerning diseases, medications or just the profession in general.

"A few years ago I got a new car and needed to update my file at the parking office at work. I kept forgetting to bring a pen and paper to the car, so I thought I’d just take a picture of the license plate so that I can transcribe later.

I get out and take a quick picture of the back of the car so I can see the plate later.  At the same time the guy parked next to me was returning to his vehicle at the same time.

Maybe I looked like I was taking random photos of his car or something but he asked

“What’d you do that for?”

I told him “My wife makes me take a picture whenever I get somewhere of my car and surroundings so she knows where I am.”

The guy didn’t say anything but had a look on his face of both shock, and disgust.

I just walked away and chuckled to myself but later on I started to feel guilty. I mean, maybe I really messed up his day?

Every once in awhile I think about that guy. And I wonder if he tells people about it. It’s weird, maybe I had an impact on his life? Maybe he forgot about me immediately and I am over thinking it?"

"[One month of daily reading!!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/494667575138189334/709582527072829510/image0.png)

Sure, I only have my goal set to 30 minutes a day. Some days I can barely handle that. But some days like you see in the picture, I’ve been reading for a lot longer than that!!

It’s been like 6 or 7 years since I’ve read more than two days in a row (mental illness is rough sometimes) and I’m really proud of myself. I’m so happy that I’m literate again. I hope this is a sign that things are getting better for me. I feel like my imagination has grown. 

Has anyone else struggled with reading? If you were able to get back into reading, what book was it that changed things for you? (Mine was the InCryptid series by Seanan McGuire and if anyone here has read that I’m on the second-to-last book and would love to talk about it!!) 

And for those of you who are avid readers, do you have any recommendations for me? I really like sci-fi and horror stuff but if a book outside of those is good enough I’m sure I’ll read it anyway :)

I just wanted to share my accomplishment, I know it might not seem like much but I’m really happy right now!! Thanks for reading!!"
"I think it's absolutely vital to happiness and self esteem, honestly. 

When you keep feelings inside, they start to fester and rot. They become grotesque and horrific, and the longer you wait the more difficult it becomes to let them go.

Even when you feel a certain way and you know it's wrong to feel that way. Even those feelings need to be talked about. 

However, I do understand what would compell someone to not let thier feels out, there's always the fear that you'll be judged, that your feelings are invalid, or you don't think you can trust anyone. Those are all valid reasons, and I do try to be available for people to let it all out if they decide to."
"Like most teens, I have been motivated to create stuff - believing money, fame and women were the final goals. I'm very lucky to have archived all of those already. But the cycle kept repeating, I wanted more money and more fame, I just couldn't get enough.  
Recently, I realized that those weren't good motivators since I couldn't really be satisfied, so I stopped trying to seek those, and for the first time - I am happy and at peace.  


Sadly, I don't really have any motivators now, and have been on bed watching Netflix and Youtube all week. I'm feeling at peace but I'm not really motivated to create / code anything. I was thinking that maybe having children would keep me motivated, but I'm only 17 so it's way to early for that.   


I don't wanna fall back to being an attention &amp; money-driven person (although it sounds tempting, it's like a drug). So, what are some good life motivators to live by?"

"So I don’t think it’s really that bad. I’ve been trying to create an interesting username for a long time. I’d really like to start building myself as a brand and it’s been extremely hard to find a simple user name. My name is Sam it’s pretty rough out there. Anyway I came up with the name Sammimafia, I own it on Instagram and other platforms now, but I’m afraid to really start working on my accounts because of what other people have said.
I understand that the mafia is real and organized crime is serious. I chose the name because I’m really interested in the mafia and I have written countless papers and school projects on it so I’m informed. 
But I’m still trying to decide what content I want to create and how I want to portray myself. I’ve always been a little bit edgy but not alternative. I love the idea of creating food and drinks, advocating for mental health and I’m interested in starting a Twitch channel. Yes I know it’s a lot of different things but I’m trying.
I’m working to lay the foundation for a career. But if I get big, I am just wondering if the user name will be a turn off for people or if I could upset the actual mob and I really don’t want that. 
I know it’s stupid and I’m probably reading too much into it. But while I think it’s a really cool username I want to be respectful. Any advice?"

"There’s some caveats due to it being because of the switch to online classes, but this semester I’ve discovered that when I actually concentrate really hard with no distractions (sadly no music, no texting, or anything outside the task), I can crank assignments out fairly efficiently.

Since starting college 3 years ago my gpa has been decent, but steadily decreasing. Last semester had been especially difficult, as I was balancing my first serious relationship, dealing with retiring from a sport I’d played for 9 years, and doing technical interviews alongside school. This is the first semester to raise my gpa, which also helps because the graduate program I’m applying to will provide automatic financial aid, the amount of which will increase with my undergrad gpa. 

I feel like I’ve always had sort of a coast and I’ll make it sort of mindset, and since during the middle of the semester I thought I was at least going to get a couple B’s and a C, but this has really boosted my confidence!

"For over a decade now, Disney Channel has shown favoritism to its live-action shows, and airs its animated shows very little.

Before, it used to be that cartoons primarily got the weekend mornings and afternoons, sitcoms primarily got prime time, late night was mixed with both, and new episodes (both cartoon or sitcom) aired in prime time.

But then in 2008 they started only airing cartoons in late night and gave new episodes shitty weekday afternoon time slots, except for Phineas and Ferb. Then in 2010 they moved new cartoon episodes to prime time, but only aired reruns on Saturday mornings which were dropped in 2014, when they gave all their cartoons away to Disney XD for one-week timed exclusivity. Then in 2016, they started airing their own cartoons in prime time only with no reruns. Then around 2017 they started only having weekend mornings for both new episodes and reruns of cartoons. In 2018, they started doing weekday afternoon new episodes and reruns for cartoons, but that did not last long at all.

They usually only keep a cartoon airing new episodes in prime time for about half of the first season, and then it gets shafted, with no rerun time slots. Why do they shaft their cartoons like this?"

"It wasn't very long ago that I questioned why so many people couldn't get through the day without a snack. Back when I was eating more, I found it ridiculous. Wasn't it just someone admitting they had to eat a fourth meal?

Then I began the process of getting in shape. This, among other things, involved eating less and cutting down on portions. Suddenly I found I was hungry all the time, and constant cravings became the number one obstacle to continuing the fitness journey.

And that's when the glories of snack time came in. This quick protein bar or bowl of carrots has been a saving grace in preventing me from eating a ginormous dinner. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I now understand the glory of the snack. To those who saw the light before I did, I'm sorry I was blinded by my own arrogance, and I beg you to forgive me for my sins."

"So I just graduated from college and after trying and trying and trying to find a job, I was offered an internship at a firm I was trying to get a full-time position at. I was (and still am) super grateful for the opportunity and accepted the offer. This job is two states away from where I grew up and without any friends or family, so I was faced with getting a car for the first time at 23. My family has never had much money, and due to corona, my dad (who made most of the money in the family) just lost his job. I knew I’d have to get an apartment and find a car on my own with the small savings I had.

Cut to today. I’ve been searching for a car and talking it over with my parents, when my grandpa (who has graciously let my family move in with him for the past 10 years) came to sit with us. The room is quiet and he asks “do you want to buy my car?”. I think he’s joking, so I humor him to say “how much?”. I can’t hear his reply so I ask him again. He says “nothing”. I laugh. And I stare at him. And I don’t know what to say. He tells me I’d have to check the tires and the oil, but I can take it for a test drive tomorrow”. After I ask him again if he’s serious, he jokes “grandma said that she wanted you to have it”. I was in 5th grade when she died, I doubt she would’ve trusted the 10 year old that I was at the time to drive anything. So I sit there. And then I start crying. My family does not cry in front of each other. I am literally sobbing and I hug my grandpa but I can’t get any words out, it all just makes me cry harder and I look like I’ve lost my mind. He tells me that he doesn’t want me to worry about it until I have a stable job and I’m making more money. He’s sick and has hardly been driving it anyways, but somehow continues to help out my family

So now I’m writing here, because my family is very bad at expressing our feelings, but I am so incredibly grateful for his kindness. My family is sitting here, watching Despicable Me, I’m trying to control my emotions, and I don’t know what to do with myself. Grandpa, I can’t thank you enough."

"I was going to the next town to get some bulk shopping as the smaller local shops offer limited variety, their is a big shopping centre that is only being used as a shortcut so people don't have to go all the way around, I felt uneasy the moment I stepped off the bus onto the empty street. As I walked towards the shopping mall I could feel my heart slowly pumping faster and faster. I finally got into the shopping centre and hadn't seen a single soul since I left the bus and the only person aboard that bus other than myself was the driver. I had gotten halfway through the empty shops and had a full on panic attack and found myself sprinting through the mall to get to the exit. I've walked empty streets in the pitch black alone when I've been at friends houses but I've never felt raw unfiltered fear like this."
" I recently found out that photons would not have left where they were initially if your eye wasn't at the exact location that it was for the photon to go into your eye. That's such a crazy concept. Also quantum physics is absolutely mind boggling. The fact that depending on where you're looking, will change the outcome of certain things. Like schrodinger's cat and other experiments like that. 

Thinking back to medieval times, theyd probably think we are gods or something if given the chance to see what we have going on nowadays. And given that scientific innovation is moving so much faster now, I think in 50-100 years humans will be able to do ""magic"". I could imagine us having implants that extend our lifespans and give us some form of telekinesis. We may also have the ability to heal rapidly and maybe even fly mostly unaided. 

Not to mention the enhanced conversations we could have due to our possible ability to communicate through our minds.

What innovations do you see coming along in the near-ish future?"

"I have a problem dwelling on embarrassing and scary memories. Even years later, after everything is OK and there's nothing to worry about, it can be hard to move on from! But I've found a way to cope: retell the memory from a funny perspective, as if you were on stand up comedy. Sharing it with friends helps me move on from it. And they laugh because it's funny!

For example: once I was pulled over out of state on a business trip. Rental car and all. 11pm at night. He turned his lights on behind me. I was in the turning lane in active traffic, turn signal on and everything. I intended on turning and pulling into a gas station right on the corner - you know, since we're in the middle of an intersection. But once that light turned green and I started to drive, I heard the cop hitting the back of my car and yelling at me! He was outside my car! I told him where I was going and did so, he spent 5 minutes yelling about why I need to stop for cops, told me to turn my headlights on (LOL! Rental car didn't have automatic lights) ran my DL and told me to go home. No fine no ticket. But you better believe I was TERRIFIED!! So that story lurked in my head for *months* and I kept dwelling on it until I finally started to tell it like a funny story. ""I ever tell you about the time I drove off on a cop? Out of state?? Oh man you wouldn't believe this--""

Just yesterday I was stupid and took too hot of a bath for too long. Felt dizzy and light headed. Went to my kitchen to get a cup of water with the intention of crashing on the couch and rehydrating. Pouring water I suddenly felt like blood was rushing out of my head. Oh no! Well, next thing I remember I'm staring at the underside of the kitchen table. I was only out for a minute, but I had no memory of falling OR hitting my head since I still have a big sore bump I'm nursing, ugh. So it was scary and I panicked a bit, but after checking myself out and ruling out any major medical emergency (no blood, no blurry vision, no headache, feeling better today) I've now begun sharing this story to all my friends. ""So I made out with the floor yesterday. Mistakes were made"" They're laughing, and I'm laughing! And I already feel better about it. My goal is to move on from this little embarrassing mishap with no more than a bump on the head and a funny story - NOT a scary situation that I need to incessantly dwell on!!

Naturally if it's something serious it's best to not make fun of it. But in almost all cases I dwell on things in the past that are perfectly OK now. Why worry about things that are said and done? Humor is my coping mechanism I guess. Just wanted to share! Anyone else do the same or want to share their own embarrassing moments turned funny stories?

Edit: those worried about my health, please don't worry guys I'm okay! I did a really stupid thing yesterday and suffered for it. I have no history of fainting but this had a legit cause. Don't overheat yourself! Stay hydrated! And maybe... if you feel faint... don't go into a kitchen with granite counters and stone tile. Carpet would've been more comfortable 🤦‍♀️"
"My mom is 65. She dealt with computers when she was working, but the she quit her job to look after me and my brother while we were growing up.

Anyone that is above thirty will remember that the past 25-30 years have been wild when it comes to technology: we made huge strides, we went from cordless phones becoming largely available, to the Internet becoming popular, to many people not even using a landline anymore, because we have a smartphone and the entire Internet in our pocket, and everything that happened in between.

So yeah, she had not really kept up with everything that happened, learning only the very basics that allowed her to make and receive calls, and exchange messages through WhatsApp. Smartphone 101, you could say. 

""The Internet"" used to be, and largely still is, a mystery to her, and she was always a very passive part of it, only using a tiny tiny fraction of it and not interacting with anything besides, you know, things like the ""play"" button on YouTube.

Recently, though, I could tell from her questions that she wanted to learn more. She didn't tell me directly, but I know her, and it became apparent.

So I sat down with her and taught her a few more things, being careful not to give her more than she can chew, so to speak.

She is a creative individual and likes to crochet, among other things, so the content she's interested in are mainly YouTube videos showing cool projects.

In a few short days she learned how to follow the channels she's interested in, how to get notifications from them, how to see the list of the channels she's subscribed to, and that the blue dot means that the channel has posted something new since the last time she visited.

Today we made another step forward, and she learned how to add clips she likes to playlists of her own.

Now, thanks to a glitch in Google I recently got a couple of notifications from a channel she subscribed to. I don't really know why it happened, I set the recovery email address to mine, and maybe it's because of that, maybe it's intended and documented behavior. I don't know. I'll figure it out, but that's not important right now.

Well, right this morning I got an email saying ""&lt;channel name&gt; has replied to your comment!"".

I opened it up and saw that it contained both the reply and her original message. Since it was a public reply to a public comment on a public video on a public channel on a public website, I figured it was okay to read.

So I did. And it was heartwarming.

It was like reading the words of and excited little girl, thanking the person behind this channel for her work and telling her everything about how she just ordered all the threads to crochet a sweater and that she couldn't wait to get them and jump right in.

And this person has been super nice in her reply, thanking her back and saying how cool it is when you make something with your hands.
My mother is good at crocheting and also very good at sewing and neither of those are things she picked up recently; in fact, she's been doing both for as long as I can remember.

So I thought: ""well, this surely is old hat to her"". Boy, was I wrong. I mean, crocheting *is* something she's done many times before, but something about commenting on the Internet made it clear how passionate she is. She would never show this much excitement in person, not even to me even though I do whatever I can in order to encourage her to pursue her interests. So this whole thing has been like a little window opening on what's going on inside her head, and I can't tell you how grateful I am that I got to witness it.

I'm now thinking of shooting a private message to the woman behind this channel to thank her and tell her a little about my mom, I think she will appreciate it.

Teaching her takes time, but I learned how to do it. I always make sure to make her do the thing she wants to learn on the phone herself, and then have her repeat it a couple of times more. Then maybe the next time I will ask her if she wants to show me how she would do the thing, and go over it once more if need be. If it's involved, I'll encourage her to take notes, and that in due time, doing it over and over, she'll memorize it.

It helps that I'm a stupidly patient guy.

And after all, I always try to keep in mind that she had to teach me how to operate a spoon back then, so it's okay if she doesn't get it right away :)

This more than made up for however much time I spent teaching her. It really did.

It may not seem that big of a deal to you guys, but seeing her going from being a passive user of the Internet to contributing a comment on a channel she loves really marks a new beginning.

It's interesting to teach her, because it helps me to digest things and make them as simple as I possibly can, which is particularly useful as a software developer. She has a hard time getting to grips with the abstractions every piece of software presents her with, but slowly I managed to get her to recognize common UI elements and the functions associated with them. We're not quite there yet, but at some point we will.

This process also delivers some ""aww"" moments when I watch her try to wrap her head around an abstraction (like telling her that folders on a computer are no different than the organizers she used in the office back when she worked).

Just yesterday I also made her her own PayPal account, to make her less scared of using her credit card to buy the things she wants. I don't expect she will be able to use it, I know she'll give me a call, and that's okay. In fact, I look forward to it.

I just hope people will always be nice to her on the Internet, I know that she would be really hurt if someone was rude in a reply to a comment of hers. However, the little communities around the sort of channel she follows are mostly made of like-minded women, young and older, and I have faith that they will behave.

That's it.

I wanted to share this, and encourage whoever is in a similar situation to be patient with their older parents. Some refuse to learn (my dad being a prime example, saying ""I'm too old for this""), others *want* to learn but are scared of even the tiniest of things that we, who are young enough to have grown up keeping the pace with technology, regard as obvious.

Remember the spoon."
"Hey, you read the title, I need to lose weight but I'm 16,jobless, and for some reason my mom likes to buy not so healthy food. What's the healthiest, cheap foods, I'm talking like $10, at most $50. Also best workouts for losing upper body weight, I'm fat, my mom refuses to acknowledge my weight, and it kinda makes me angry at times. I need advice on how to lose weight in my current situation. Sorry if this is rambly."
"Man, the internet used to be sick, or at least that’s how I perceived it back in like 2011-2014. Everything seemed slightly less artificial and more new.

Maybe the astroturfing was just better back then.

We need a subreddit where political spam and other negative content that’s just fuel for anger doesn’t exist,but otherwise, it’s all free game. Basically, the subreddit equivalent of VSauce’s old DONG series."
"I remember when i had a keyboard phone all the way up until I was 17. We didn’t have autocorrect, but it was easy because it was so similar to a desktop set up. 


Well I’ve gotten fed up with autocorrect always incorrectly autocorrecting so I got curious. Holy shit, it corrects so much stuff I didn’t even realize. Ive already had to correct like almost every 5 words I’ve written on here. 


Maybe I never realized how difficult it actually was to write on my little Iphone screen, and how it has essentially been normalized to fuck up almost everything I write and for the little computer to fix it. 


Has anyone else tried this?"
"I've never paid too much attention to her, but I feel as if whenever she makes a banger it's heard everywhere and she's just an artist that you can't really hold anything against"

My biggest source of happiness in my life comes from having a very well cooked meal. I'm talking about the type of restaurant where the chef decided he was going to be the greatest in the world. No shortage of those in South Florida but it'll put a hole in your wallet. My biggest source of motivation to create my own startup and become wealthy is the thought of eating a 5 star meal every day without feeling guilty about the cost. How do you guys feel about fine dining?
"hi guys so i have been wanting to read since i want to learn more or do something that will help me in the long run. i dont know what book will help me get started with this since some  im kinda new to it? i like books that are intellectual, mysterious, something that ill learn from :)"
"After many weeks of having Bible Study via Zoom, we finally got to meet in person! Which means I got to leave my house, and go to someone else's home! We had some light snacks, and some really great discussion. This one lady bought brownies, and said that she was going to bring a pie, but realised I didn't like pie, so she bought brownies instead.

I'm just so happy she thought about me, and cared enough about me to change what she bought. A very welcome change from the usual.

How's your day? Anyone have a similar experience? Or the exact opposite? Lemme know in the comments below!"
"I have been on this platform for a few days now, and my opinion of it is very good! :)

Now I just need to find my son on here, and troll him Haha!

I swear the first month I lived here I heard it every day. The second people find out you're from The East they feel the need to loudly exclame how their side of the country is so much better. Honestly this phrase turned me off of the west coast.
"It's been 4 years since we lost touch. Despite being unemployed since the Covid-19 lock down, I just felt so content just because we're talking again. We talked about fun times we hung out, our goals in life, and how we're going to make our parents proud.

Hope life is treating all of you well!"
"I find it helps me when I’m procrastinating it really hard. Any online game that has a period of waiting between matches, I’ll sometimes get up and get as much done around me as I can before the next match starts. This activity itself becomes its own game. Sometimes I’ll be disappointed that I have to quit what I was doing so soon, causing me to look forward to the next cleaning burst.

The short burst of cleaning exercise fires me up for the upcoming round and vice versa.


Games I’ve done this with:


- Various Call of Duty games. Great way to dilute the salt, too! Put that frustration to good use if you just got stomped.


- Smash Bros. Ultimate. In an Arena when you’re waiting your turn. Doesn’t work so well if you stay in the top two, though, so you might want to lose on purpose every so often."
"Through the mess of this virus, it has allowed my family to be together and within a month my mother has been diagnosed, tested and gotten surgery to remove her cancer. If it was any normal time she wouldn't have gotten the test for months. Have a beautiful day!"
"Hi folks! Recently, I've been feeling as though I'm losing a sense of individuality and personality. As a designer by trade, we are taught to be codependent in creating with others, and ever since quarantine, the person-to-person connection just isn't there.

So I wanted to ask you all, what makes you unique and interesting as an individual?

I know this is a very generic question that interviews have ruined for many people but I couldn't think of a better way to ask this and at its core, it's still a very interesting question!"
"So i had my interview and they are suppose to call me in about 16 hours to let me know if i got the job, and suggestions? 
I'm nerves, i feel good about it cause the interviewer liked me and i was able to make her slightly laugh while staying on topic and making small appropriate talk. Was that a good thing that i did that?
I feel like it went well and she seemed to like me but idk I'm quiet nerves and excited this is the first time i got an interview because the rest of the places i applied for (which is a lot) didn't ever reach out to me.

"What is something that isn’t crazy hard to do or requires other rare ingredients that I should use this yeast to indulge with?? I have some flour too so we should be good on most of the standard baking ingredients. I saved the last batch of yeast at Easter and made hot cross buns, but curious if I should try something new! No dietary restrictions"
"So I live in a girl's hostel and we all were sitting and chatting about our breast size . Now person (A) tells me her boobs are big and she lifts up her shirt (she has a bra ) Person (B) does the same thing. Now I'm a person who is very shy but for some reason I lift up my shirt COMPLETELY FORGETTING I DON'T HAVE A BRA
I also didn't realise this until 2 minutes later .My friends were laughing their asses off (not in the bad way but a playful way ) but for someone who is really shy this was embarrassing. 
So yeah I was just sitting and thinking about this and I wanted to talk about it 
Hope you guys are having a good day"
"Not out of like desperation, I just think I made a pretty good dinner and would like to show it off. I’m cool eating alone but it’s nice to feed someone. Anybody else proud of their dinner?"
"So I’ve been wondering about this for a few months now. I read a lot on the internet. Stories, Light novels, reddit posts, books, and of course little snippets around the internet, like I assume most people do nowadays, but whenever I come across a considerably long post, either here or somewhere else, I am always one to read through the whole thing. Even if it’s 1000 words and maybe 50 top comments, I’ve encountered some longer ones. 

But if I send something “long” to my girlfriend or friends, some of them refuse to read it in its entirety cause it’s too many words, or not worth the time. 

So...What do y’all do? Do you read every detail, or do you only go through the “bite-size” ones?


Feel free to share if you gone through something similar with others?"
"Have you learned any new hobbies or skills in the past couple months? 

I feel bad that I've been kind of wasting the opportunity of these last couple months of mostly being at home. I could have learned a new skill or hobby, instead of mostly playing video games (which is also a hobby, but I've played enough video games for one lifetime already). I tried to get into biking and running, but I kind of hate both of them. Other than that I haven't tried anything new. There are so many great resources online now to learn anything you want to, I have no excuses."

"We’ve all got songs that immediately remind us of a specific moment in time, a fond memory, or a person we know/used to know. What are some of your songs? Tell me about the memories too, if you feel like it."
Today I feel in the mood for helping people. I don't really have anything specific I want to help with so ask me anything. I have had minor experience in counselling but not a lot. Although I have had troubles as a 14-year-old with seeing my dad. I got through them and now looking for people to help and give advice. This might be considered a touchy topic and if so I apologise.
"it was pure hell listening to this person talk about how they're financially dependant on their parents and doesn't have any plans to change that in the future. And they think that its cool or cute to actually do that when its just annoying and makes them a lazy, irresponsible and dependant person who can't decide anything by themselves and is literally wasting their parents money and energy.

on the other hand though, I personally think that people can lightly brag about something as long as they are the one that achieved it, no matter how small it is, if they worked hard on it, and they deserved it. 

what are your opinions on this?"
"There's a weeder pre-major Economics class at the university that caps the percentage of students earning A+, A, and A-, B+, B, B-, C+ at no more than 1, 4, 8, 16, 30, 40, and 50 percent of students respectively. There is no cap for C grades, you just need to get above 40 percent and you can get a C. Anything below that is a D or F.   

There's usually around 300 students in the class, there are 3 exams: 2 midterms worth 25 percent each, and a final worth 50 percent of the grade. No makeup for missed exams. It's a weeder class, so all of the students are motivated to do well in order to preserve their Gpa in the major. Typically the exams are half multiple choice (with 5 answer choices), half free response with strict time limit of 40 minutes for a midterm and 2 hours for the final. 

To earn an A- you would have to have a raw score better than 92 percent of the students in the class (Top 24) , for an A better than 96 percent (Top 12) and for a B better than 70 percent (Top 90), etc. The professor posts a bunch of practice tests, some powerpoint slides / recorded lecture, weekly problem sets, and you can get help from the Ta's if need be every week.

So let's chat and become friends, because as it stands right now, I don't have any."
"For context, I have an Australian accent. As far as I know, I’m quite well-spoken, and friends from other English speaking countries (England, America, and New Zealand) have never had trouble understanding me. I really don’t think my accent is particularly thick, nor do I use a lot of obscure slang. 
Anyone else with a similar experience?"
"I suppose I'm looking for points from both sides.

I'm a very logical decision maker. I remove any emotion that I have and make my decisions based strictly on logic. I'll over analyze many situations in order to view all possible outcomes (positive, negative, and inbetween). I know that this was instilled in me when I was very young, but its gotten me to where I am today. I've got a great career, I own both of my vehicles and I'm purchasing property that ill own in 2 more years. Thats not too bad for my age in my opinion.

Everything that I've ever done, I've put a lot of thought into. Whenever I made a choice I'd make sure that my judgment wasn't clouded by my desires. (Thats not to say that I always play it safe, because I definitely dont.) 

I've ended relationships and friendships both directly and indirectly because of my choices (ex. Moving across the country for jobs/ altering my financial situation). I've known the risks and possible outcomes for everything that I've done.

Recently, I broke down all possible outcomes for another decision that I had to make. The logical path was very clear to me, but I decided to act based off of what I wanted this time. 

I flew +1300 miles and drove another +350 miles. (So I had time to think it through) I once again began breaking down the facts and told my buddy what was going to happen, and wasn't surprised in the slightest that I hit the nail on the head.

Basically I'm wondering if there's anyone else that lives like this, and how they feelabout where their life is right now. What about the opposite? Someone who makes their decisions based solely on what they want? Where did that lead you and how do you feel about it?"

I have twelve years to fulfill this promise. I don't know exactly how I'm gonna do that, or if this house will even still be for sale when the times comes. But I'm making a commitment to getting it, starting today. I'll work to build up my skills, adding value as a worker in order to receive higher paying jobs, or just start a business if I can gain the capital and knowledge. Then when I get to making $135K per year, I'll buy it at 30% down.

"It's such a great sensation when you go back to a band/artist that you haven't listened to in years and the magic you used to see in their music remains intact. It's weird how easy it is for us to forget something we like so much as we discover other things. I'm really glad for these random encounters with something I knew already, but for some reason left behind. I'm feeling kinda hyped now even though I've explored this band's discography back and forth 

 I'm really curious if anyone is getting back into things they liked before or if they just kinda let it die and move on. So, are you guys currently reminiscing anything?"

I seriously can not believe it, years writing physical notes, and no one in my house ever noticed. EVER.
Just wanted to telltale.

Tell me some similar stories that happened to you.

Update: I'm still talking with them about it. They don't believe that I've been doing it for years. They think it only happened one time (yesterday) and that because I mentioned it."

"I feel like I've accumulated many collections during my lifetime (movies, games, books, etc.), and I have those urges to just get rid of them all to live a simpler lifestyle where I don't have to maintain my ever-piling things.

"I was browsing through my tv's extensive collection of screensavers (43"" screen) thinking how long do I have to scroll to get to the end when I saw the reddit logo screensaver icon. I immediately paid the .99 cents, added 5 or 6 subreddits (like pics, awww, humansbeingbros, ect.) and set it to turn on after 1 minute of being idle.

It's like auto browsing reddit while only being partly in control but the bottom line is that I'm pretty stoked to have found it and it's great to look at while listening to podcasts.

I wanted to tell someone about this who might appreciate it and since people in this subreddit have always been so nice to everybody this seemed like the idel place.

I've lived alone in the same studio apartment (major New England city) for 20+ years with each day more or less like the one before until a couple of months ago when I got a phone call from my sister who lives in another state. Our mother had passed away a few weeks before, left $7,000.00 and since she and my brother are well off (and I'm doing okay on a fixed income) they agreed to offer it to me (I said ""thank you""). My sister suggested sending $500.00 checks to me to spend on whatever I wanted (she's sent 3 so far) and I always wanted a smart 4K tv while still being grateful for the still used 33"" 780 HD tv that had new life breathed into when I bought a firestick a few months ago (speaking into that remote is pretty cool).

So, like most people, I'm spending more time at home but unlike most people the quality of my homelife has improved by leaps and bounds over the last few weeks as assorted amazon packages have arrived with contents chosen to turn my small apartment into the techno/geek cave I always dreamed of (from time to time).

The screensaver picture changes every 5 seconds and it's almost hypnotising. Definitely the best ninety-nine cents I've ever spent. 

Me: 62 years young (I live like a college student who never goes to class) pot smoking former artist (no longer have the compulsion to draw so I haven't in years), regular internet surfer who spends enough time on reddit to feel the spirit time with Netflix and Prime subscriptions that get a lot of use.

Maybe it's a combination of the imposed isolation but I've writing more and posting thoughts (reviews lately) on line and since I've always like getting mail feel free to write if you have any questions about the rest of the stuff I bought or what it's like to be this old (had I known I'd be around this long I'd have exercised more) but at least I'm in relatively good health and with no chronic complaints.

I've been on reddit for about a decade (I'm guessing) and think this is my 3rd account (I was off totally for a while but now I'm back daily and AND for the first time ever, last week, bought reddit gold-yep, I joined the lounge too).

Save It For The Show was my favorite podcast for the better part of decade and when it ended a couple of years ago I couldn't bring myself to listen to the last episode of a show that I had looked forward to each week for so many years while developing a internet friendship with one of the hosts that continues to this day (shout out to Dan Fields).

The grief ran deep but I knew that one day it would ebb and I would finally catch up. That day was today. I listened to the last 3 episodes (starting with the most recent and unexpected Corona 2020 podcast that just came out) and smiled at my shout out on 2 of them. Each one was great in its own way (I wrote Dan and told him). 

Newly flush with cash one personal change is that I no longer have to mentally do the math to see if I can afford something fun in the ten to twenty dollar range on woot! A few days ago a bought a mouse pad that I saw in a woot! email that I never knew existed.

It's 33""x11"", usb powered  and the edge lights up with 12 different settings. Best mouse pad ever.

Anybody else had any unexpected good news lately?

Best part is, they allow colorful hair! I’m bummed to have to leave my clinical job but I’m excited to have the freedom to make one of my small dreams come true. 

Once my hairdresser is taking clients again and after COVID-19 has run it’s course, I’m getting my purple highlights."
"When I was in school, we had a boy that was deaf.

It was a really small school so we had the responsibility of looking after him sometimes. He was one of the most kind-hearted kids I have ever met. Whenever one of us looked sad or fell over, he would comfort us, as we would to him. He was so funny and light hearted that it was almost impossible not to smile when he was around, even if he was causing a scene. 

Their perseption of the world is so different to ours, but it is the best, and it makes people happy, and when other people are happy, it makes you happy.

Be kind to our disabled or handicapped people, they are truly wonderful. :)"
"This morning, the lockdown came to a an end and I could finally visit my mother's friend giving me and my girlfriend a kitty for our place. I only saw him through pictures before that and holding him in my hand was pretty amazing. His name is Logan and he already went to me for cuddle. I have to wait for another 3 weeks to take him home I can't wait. I took a video this morning where he plays with my girlfriend's fingers and I'm watching it over and over. I'm so happy !"
"So its my bday in about 20 minutes and honestly i dont know what to do.

I have friends and family im supper happy people are messaging  me and its nice change of vibe from this whole quarantine.

However i dont know what to do this year. Obviously with the quarantine i dont have many options. I did have a small gathering of 4 people earlier today ( i am sorry for not reapecting the social  distancing but we kept it as safe as possible) we talked and caught up with  eachother since its been a minute  we havnt seen eachother.

Anywyas people who had birthdays during the quarantine, do you guys have any good suggestions or ideas for a ""party"". Of course not a real party. But any ideas how to celebrate while still being safe?

Any suggestions  are welcome! 

Im personally just happy all my friends and family havnt been affected by the pandemic  yet. And i want to keep it this way. But ya let me know what you guys did for your birthday this year maybe ill get some inspiration!"
"As someone that suffers from chronic allergies I have noticed a great improvement when I wear a mask. I know it’s just a fabric 3-layer one and not a medical one, but it helps so much.

I take Claritin and Flonase each day to manage my allergies. I’ve enjoyed spending time outside gardening without the bad allergies and fear of a sinus infection. I wish I wore these before and even after covid-19 I plan to wear them more often.

Anyone else feeling better with the face mask?"
Been doing it the last few weeks and I love it. It sucks but it's a fun challenge. Put that shit on ice cold and then try to last at least minute. Will snap you right out of those thought loops and leave you feel amazing. It also helps lower blood pressure and relaxes you deeper than a hot shower which leads to better sleep
"My Mom has been in a several year long battle with depression and her health has MAJORLY deteriorated through out the ordeal. She had been talking to doctors, consulting experts, and trying everything we could think of to get back on top of things. It was looking like she'd be spending the rest of her life bedridden.

Until, the other day, she decided to wean herself off of her antidepressants to see if they were potentially the cause of her physical problems.

She was right.

So far she's about 3 weeks into lowering her dose in an effort to eventually be off of them. And in that time, she's been walking around again, getting back into her hobbies, touring a new house she's planning to move into, and playing with my little siblings.

Not only that, but I called her today to wish her a happy mother's day, and I started crying because the old timbre in her voice was there. It felt like hearing my mom's voice for the first time in years. I couldn't believe it. Her voice has the power it used to, she's quick and witty again just like I remember her, and she's happy and excited for her future.

Over the course of a few weeks, she's gone from accepting that she's going to spend the rest of her life in a bed, only able to offer ""hang out in bed with mom"" time to her kids, to having the strong, smart, witty, and active woman she was, nearly within reach.

I'm really hopeful that this continues, because I'm more excited than words can describe that my mom is getting her life back!

Happy mother's day to you all! Call your mom's and tell them you love them!



Edit: Shout-out to my step dad who won't ever read this for having her back through everything. A real man.

Edit 2: Y'all commenting made my momma cry 😭 She very much appreciates you :) I will continue to share any new comments with her!"
I broke my ankle three weeks ago and had some tingling in my toes which the doctor identified as Neurapraxia or nerve shock. He said it should get better in line with the injury. Anyone experienced this? How did you deal with it when you started using the limb again?
"And that made me feel really nice, because I don't ordinarily play FPS PvP games. So thank you to those 3 people. That made my day. :) 

Anyone else play Overwatch here? Who's your preferred character?"
"So I'm class of 2020, and go to a semi rich highschool. I honestly did not like my school, they were very greedy with money and the kids that came from the rich kids were very snobby. My school is mixed with high income and low income students, I'm low income. But yeah, they were greedy, a lot of programs were cut and students had to pay for a lot of things. But since this cancellation happened, everyone has gotten togethor and teamed up which is nice. Every senior now has a sign with decoration specific for them in front of their house placed by our leadership. The school and parents are using all their money to give us a grad party after quarantine, the only reason I know is cause my parents are friends with the schools board of directors and stuff, some other students know but it's a small amount. So yeah, we have a huge part planned with one of the parents mansions and some plans of a carnival in their back yard since it's big enough, prom is now completely free and has been pushed back. Graduation, we dont have to pay for our cap and gown now. They basically made it so that we already graduated so I have no more school work a month early. They are also honoring all athletes, so I have some stuff coming in like my jersey and a lettermen jacket for free and other things that I dont know what they are. So yeah, my school isnt as bad as I thought. I'm pretty sure no one got this far, and if you did, what was your graduation and post graduation like, any advice for a person finally graduating? I'm asking cause I'm going to college and I dont know what to expect?"
"Honestly, they’re just so adorable sometimes. Especially having a pet for a few years and watching them grow up. I have a dog but just all pets in general"
"So...recently there was a father that deleted his childs minecraft world,which is (or atleast was)all over reddit,made me think about how can he kind of repair the damage he has done,what do you guys think(if any psychologists read this please take the time to leave a comment).
Im only 20 but i think its important for me to know, maybe someday i mess up too,or have a friend that does and i can help him.
I dont bellive that anyone can mess a father and son relationship so bad that its beyond repair,and i think reddit comments and posts only made the guy disappointed in himself as a father(which will potentially cause more bad parenthood)so i think my question may help that father too (if he reads it of course)."
"Anyone else struggling with this? Normally I really like to cook but lately I find myself relying on processed, packaged foods and not doing much real cooking. Have you been cooking more or less since quarantine started? I have been having a hard time finding certain foods at the grocery store when I go. Everything is all picked over for the most part"
"I feel like it’s a good day to remind everyone that you are worthy of kindness and love and tenderness and friendship and every good thing in the world no matter what you’ve been through! Take care of yourself today, did you eat? Did you sleep well? Did you take your medication? Don’t forget to remind yourself that everything is going to be alright so don’t give up! I am here for any one of you if you ever need a friend to talk to and I sincerely mean that. I am proud of you for how far you’ve come. 

Have a brilliant day!"
What I mean like this is that I know that the English name of a country is not the actual name. Ex: Germany is actually called Deutschland in Deutsche (German). The reason I’m asking this is because I want to make a world map that can educate people on the real names of countries.
"Although I feel myself getting more and more drowsy. What about you? Tired, awake, etc. If I for some reason fall asleep I won’t feel bad for leaving you until the morning time comes."
"I’m an illustrator and I only post my art on Instagram. I really love Instagram, but I don’t know why it is such a big stressful thing to me.

People might read this and think ‘it’s only Instagram, why does she care?’, but I put a lot of pressure on my self to post consistently and post only work I truly love. And it sounds silly but I always get nervous before I post a new picture incase no one likes it. (In a button and thought way).

When my posts don’t do as well as other posts of mine it makes me feel really unmotivated and sad, as well as when I lose followers. I find it really disheartening, thinking I’m losing followers or likes because people aren’t liking my illustrations. 

I think generally Instagram is a big motivator for me, I want to post regularly and sometimes I feel it is the only thing making me continue to push myself to work. So maybe that’s why I get a bit sad.

Maybe I’m just full of self doubt. 

This probably sounds really petty aha"
"From 10-12 I was into AC/DC, Green day and Simple Plan. 13-18 I was mostly into hip hop (Eminem, Jay z, Kanye west, Dr.Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Drake) and when I was 19-20 if it wasn’t Metallica/Megadeth/Deep Purple/AC/DC/, I wouldn’t listen to it. Now I’m 22 and my taste has expanded into various sub-genres Such as Flamenco (paco de Lucia, Manolo sanlucar) and progressive rock (Dream Theater)"
"I always had it for decoration reasons, but I decided to pick it up and play it, learned some basic stuff off of YouTube and I can actually play some songs! I feel really proud of myself"
"Only 10 more days and it’s gone!! Gone for good. 10 more days and I go get my thyroid removed. 10 more days and I won’t be depressed anymore. 10 more days and I won’t ever have to worry about randomly not eating or sleeping for 3 days. 10 more days and I can actually run, workout, and do more than just walking. 10 more days and the embarrassing, uncontrollable mood swings will be gone. I won’t ever have to worry about just randomly bursting into tears of sadness and laughing like a maniac. I won’t ever have to worry about my Grave’s Disease fucking up my hormones. I can do more than walking. I can get my job back at the restaurant. I can enjoy my summer and not have worry about school. 

I CAN LIVE!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!

Edit: I’m thinking about saying “Does anyone need anything while I’m out?” right before I pass out for surgery.

Edit 2: Since a lot of people are pointing this out: I am fully aware that there is still a lot ahead of me. I still have to find the right synthetic hormone dose, which can take a very long time. I know that I will still have a lot of symptoms from Grave’s and that I will never truly be cured. But, all those symptoms will be much more smaller and manageable, which is all I need. My point of view on this surgery is a sort of turning point in life. I can do so much more in life after this surgery. I’m still very excited, 9 more days!"
I would talk with you guys but my mom and stepdad say I can’t cause it’s dangerous. I just wanna talk to someone on the internet cause almost everyone I know from school is a big bully specially mike. He’s a buttwipe. But I’m sorry I would talk with you guys but my mom goes through my phone and she would get really mad :(

"After years of  being indecisive on what I want to be when I grow up, I (24f) think I want to pursue dentistry. 
My dilemma is, do I deserve to be in control of others oral health when I haven't worried about my own.
The past year or so, I've gone through pregnancy and depression to the point of not really caring about my own health at all. Especially oral care. My teeth aren't healthy and I'm so disappointed in myself.

Even though I've changed my habits, is that something I should really pursue?

"So I had loads of playlists on Spotify and wanted to clear the clutter and delete all the repeats within each playlist - so there you are....

Some may call it a wasted 2 hours but I think it was really well spent :)"
"On Instagram I stalked thru the followers of the developer of some thing I played online when I was young, basically just a stroll through nostalgia. Checked thru the profiles to see if any of them were big, I just figured it would be funny if any of them were. I saw one of them was being followed by a meme page I follow, and it just seemed like such a weird coincidence, I had to follow this person. She followed me back, started liking my posts, I started liking her posts, eventually responded to something she said on her story, asked her if I could randomly send her memes, we agreed and began randomly sending each other memes, realized just how ridiculously much we had in common with these memes and specific subjects, memes turned into conversations (not that the memes went away of course, we got to know more and more about each other. We've been spending like 3 hours a day messaging each other, and I've told her things I've spent so much of my life only daydreaming about being able to tell people, and I think she's had similar experience telling me about things. She lives halfway across the planet and we don't have any mutual acquaintances. We've both fantasized about how nice it'd be if we met each other irl but that might not ever happen. I mean for all I know she could just be an extremely advanced ai or an ultra dedicated fucking troll or some shit, but now... god it feels so cringy saying this but I actually feel like I care about her now... like if something bad happened to her I'd genuinely break down. I've heard it said that you don't really know who someone is until you meet them, but honestly I don't think you ever truly know who someone is for certain it's a sliding scale. And I feel like I know this girl from across the planet better than most people I've met irl anyways, so..."
"So me and 4 other freinds (including my brother) all decided to pay for a realm together and WOW in a month we've bet the ender dragon for the first time, stacked up on elytras and I've just started on building a kingdom.

I highly recommend getting together some good freinds and playing some wholesome minecraft (or whatever game you love)"
"Even though I'm American, I swear I am in love with Pizza-Pizza. yes I'm aware it's a pizza chain in Canada lol just like papa johns or dominos here. But whenever I would go to Canada to visit my ex or visit my family it's all I craved when I was there, maybe it's something that I also associate with good memories lol. idk.  

My dad flew out of Toronto for business last summer and I begged him to bring me back pizza-pizza for me on his way home (I was watching my parents dogs). He brought back a veggie pizza for me (extra large pizza with olives, red onions, mushrooms and green peppers) and I'm pretty sure I ate like half in the first sitting it was so delicious. Costco pizza comes in at a close second (I know, I have the taste buds of a 3 year old). 

So pizza-pizza lovers (or, general pizza loving people), what is your go-to order?"

"After my post on r/trueoffmychest i have gained alot of messages and replies from different people a felt a motivated, It has a been a couple of days since and now i'm feeling much better, I'm getting back on track and staying away from the internet so i can study more, My tutors all are saying that i'm doing great, I'm working hard to get my 9th grade degree and finish this mess so i can fly back to greece.

I always thought the internet was a not so great place to open up about your emotions and feeling but i guess i was wrong, I'm trying to find more hobbies in my free time, I'm learning more and more about fixing different kinds of electronics, And trying to squeeze in some time to learn a bit of greek on duolingo before the bird either kills me because i missed like 10 days since i downloaded the app or i just lose all interests and get to greece and making it harder for myself till i get proper teaching, I might miss a year which i'm really bummed about but its all fine because i made a 2 friends while going their which i still talk to this day with since my trip in january, Very nice country and people too.

Well for my mental being, Its getting better, I'm feeling more happy since i'm progressing through everything and making dreams and goals for myself to take on !.

I'm starting to realize that i'm talking to myself alot, In the past couple of years, While gaming, studying, Anything, Honestly talking to myself makes me feel better, i talk to myself like there is someone next to me or like im recording my video, i don't know if its something i should worry about but my parents said its all fine. So yeah...

I have to currently go to sleep since my tutor is coming at 12pm tomorrow, i studied at the morning, Then my arab tutor came and then i continued.

Honestly 9th grade is so over rated in syria, everyone tells me or us that its so hard but no actually, it might be because i'm in a private school ? I really don't know actually... but i have 7 subjects (Math, Science,religion,French, arabic, english and social studies which are history geography and national education) so i finished 4 of them and still got 41 days to go, Yay... i guess. Exams are on the door, Social studies is he hardest so far, Since i'm now repeating math and science and arabic and History and geography and i don't study english because its to easy for me.

I get bullied for my HEAVY british accent yet i'm practicing normal American Accent so i can be more understandble for Non native english speakers. Because sometimes i'm not audible or they cant understand me.

How about you people ? Anything you want to share ? Reply i guess and have a fun day/night !"
"Don't get me wrong, I love not going outside but I think I'm going to be a bit crazy here when I start doing the technical subjects (coding, math etc)"
"I left home at 16 to live in a van and couch surf. When I was 18 I went to live with family in a different state and my addiction that I'd been struggling with really took off and I burned a lot of bridges. I was homeless again and was then allowed home under the stipulations that I go to rehab. After rehab I moved into a recovery house for a year and a half then left to go live with a cousin I didn't really know in a different city. It ended up being a terrible living situation and I moved onto someone's couch back in my home city until I was able to find to find a roommate to get an apartment with. All of our furniture was hand me down stuff from family and friends. My roommate moved out after 2 years and my boyfriend moved in. She left the furniture here  because she had decided to buy all new everything. 

I've been clean for 5 years on the 18th and my life is so beyond better than anything I could have ever imagined and yesterday I bought a brand new rug that matched the living room perfectly. I know it doesn't seem like much, but it's mine. I bought a friggin rug! As soon as I got home and cleaned and rolled it out, I just laid on it for an hour. I'm proud of me and my life and it took me so long to be able to say that. Money has been tight with everything going on but the rug has a tiny seam issue and I got a good deal on it and it's just perfectly imperfect. Yet another reason it just symbolizes right where I'm at. 

If you've read this, thank you for being part of my journey."

"Aged 31 and cooking using my old trusty pans and that blunt knife set that was gifted to me years ago i finally bought new, and my god the difference is like night and day! Food would stick usually which meant more hassle cleaning, used more oil, woudnt cut properly, it was ""I'll get them next week"" 

After the first use now I can't wait to use them again! This is when I realised it's happened, this is adulting peak at its finest."
"The COVID world has really gotten to me. I’m usually a very positive and outgoing person, but being quarantined and not being able to see my friends and family has been a huge bummer and has effected my mental health some. I’ve been trying to keep busy with creative things, I’m usually a really productive artist but even that has slowed down and my motivation is next to nothing. Just wanting to get back to some sort of normalcy and create things again, trying hard to pull myself out of this head space. And my cat is sick and it breaks my heart! Truly just venting here, I’m sorry to post."
"This was my first time selling on eBay and when someone made the purchase I was ecstatic, but little did I know that the buyer was going to make a claim of ""wrongful images"". Now I ate $20 in costs, and my entire month is ruined because I was planning to continue to sell on eBay but I had no idea that my very first posting was going to lose me $20. I already have so many items taped and ready to go but I don't even want to use their service anymore. My blood is boiling and I'm just so upset."
"I don't have a very impressive list of skills, and I'm just leaving high school now. Here's my skill set:

* Working with little kids
* Selling things
* Running numbers/handling cash
* Washing dishes and other simple tasks

And here's my actual work experience:

* Summer day camp for my former elementary school (2019).

I can't figure out how I could actually use this to get myself a job. What should I do?"
"Yesterday I came home from work and was carrying in my computer and a bunch of other stuff from work. I dropped my computer case by the door so I could unlock it. Then I totally spaced it...

Last night in the dead of sleep I just sat up and thought ""OMG I LEFT MY COMPUTER OUTSIDE""... Sure enough I walk outside and it's sitting right by my front door.

Why do I do this?? Just completely space something and then clearly remember it like 12 hours later??"
"This is my speech, take your seats.

&amp;#x200B;

 I woke up nice and late, had some good ass dreams.

Stayed in bed watched some funny youtube videos.

Went and got a nice cold shower did some stretches and shadowboxing.

Went for a nice little run in the park.

Came back had a nice fruit smoothie and watched a few episodes of ""normal people""

Zoom call with my friends followed by some total war shogun online 

Simply phenomenal dinner

Stuck the electric fire on and closed the curtains even tho it was still light outside to make it cosy

Listened to some summer time music while playing games

Looked at what i had planned to do work wise for the day and realised i had done nothing.

Happily continued playing games and then took a nice warm bath.

Now sitting scrolling reddit ready to go to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Got absolutely nothing accomplished but i enjoyed myself and ended one more day closer to the end of quarantino with some positive energy.

My speech has ended i hope it was inspirational."
"(If this is too serious for this sub, my apologies. It didn't seem too serious to me.)

A lot of my reasons for being on the fence about kids stem from my childhood: no siblings and two toxic parents. I really need love. There's no two ways about it. I hate all that self-help crap that tells you to ""work on yourself."" I've done all I can, and this is me. I think I would make a good mom, but I just fear that if I had kids, my future husband would love them more than me, and that would absolutely destroy me, so I won't be allowing that to happen. One of my much older friends is also like this, and seems happy, but she's always danced from boyfriend to boyfriend because they all pressured her to have kids. I just want one person I can spend the rest of my life with, not worrying that he'll pressure me to have kids, or care for them more than me. I'd rather be single forever than experience that."
"I just got an emulator and Im not playin Pokemon Emerald Version. I can’t wait to finish it. Its so fun. Idk why I never tried to start it before lol

"Sleep paralysis is v scary. You wake up, but you can’t move. You feel like something is sitting on your chest or that you’re sinking into your mattress. You might even think you see something or someone sitting on your chest – or you’ll witness some other figure lurking in the room."
"I had always just eyeballed amounts, or tried to pour things out of a square container, or use my tablespoon to measure out 3 cups of whatever... but I finally bought a proper grown up measuring jug and I made the best pancakes I've ever cooked.

I am very happy. I needed to share ^^"
"So I was tested positive a couple weeks ago, and had to be moved to a rundown motel to isolate for a week. It was the worst experience I can ever recall having. Worst than being homeless.

If being isolated wasn't bad enough, it's the fact the motel has really poor wifi. I wasn't able to connect to anyone online let alone distract myself from the situation. I was basically twiddling my thumbs all week.

One positive to take away from this bad experience is that my time is valuable and I should not waste it nor let anyone try to take it away from me.

One negative to take away is I wholeheartedly distrust the health department now. I felt like I was being punished for testing positive and that's bullshit. I'm released now, but I'm still very pissed off at them for not isolating me somewhere with appropriate amenities. I feel that people who do have to isolate deserve better than this.

Anyone with similar experiences?"
"I absolutely love celebrating holidays. I usually go all out and do extravagant gifts/surprises. I’m quarantined with my dog and boyfriend, and I gathered his online friends (all from different parts of the country) that he’s known for 10+ years and we sung happy birthday to him through Zoom. I can’t go out to any places that are opening right now, I’m immunocompromised sadly. Any suggestions on what we could do to celebrate being able to legally buy and consume alcohol? :D"
"Since quarantine has started, I've noticed an increase in my online shopping (as well as other things but I digress). I mean, it's not uncommon and I'm not saying it is. Even my mom has stepped into the world of purely online shopping and I even introduced her to Amazon and PayPal.

I was just thinking while I was clicking around a website late last night and realized that I think I'm at the point now during this quarantine where I genuinely contemplate ordering things online just to have something to look forward to...something to get excited about. 

I mean, I am looking forward everything being alright again but I would a liar if I said I wasn't nervous. Especially given that I work with A LOT of paper (I work in a library) that will be coming directly from people's homes...

And honestly, I feel selfish talking about this since I know how hard it is for some people out there and that I just managed to be a lucky one. I just made this observation because I was genuinely contemplating spending quite a bit of money on a new figure even though I already told and promised myself that I'm only allowed two more purchases.

Just an observation. Have a nice day and hope you're able to stay safe.

Edit: Clarified what I meant when I said I ""work with A LOT of paper""...I work in a library. Super sorry, I didn't make that clear."

"And if so, I'd love to hear your stories!

I just had a solid moment of realizing I'm so fucking bisexual after discovering Lauren Babic (especially her Toxic and Afterlife covers) as well as American Avenue (their Gasoline cover is 10/10, fucking amazing). I've had built-in doubts that I'm only passingly attracted to women, but, nope, I'm 1000% gay for Lauren Babic and a number of other women but also 1000% straight for the lead singer of American Avenue and a number of other men. I'm a little wine-drunk, so I'm just a heap of giddy giggles upon this realization.

Do you guys ever have these realizations? I would love to hear them! (They don't have to be sexuality related--just I am so \[happy/creative/clever/etc\])"
"Hey everyone,

I'm laying in bed at 3:50 am right now, listening to I'm Yours by Jason Mraz trying to stay afloat.

I'm in my last year of high school, and my depression has been hitting hard the last few days.

Something that always helps me feel better is hearing what makes people happy - whether it be spending time with a certain person, the demeanor of their pets, being in a place special to them, an occasion, anything. I call memories like these Patronus Memories(since they're what you need to conjure a Patronus in Harry Potter) and reading some people's right now would really help.

I'll start -
One of my favourite memories is a day that I spent in San Francisco with my best friend. We missed the train, got breakfast, ran to catch the next one, walked miles to get ice cream, ate it in the sunset, walked back, and took the train home. We reached back at 10:30pm.

I'm sorry, I can't gather my thoughts enough to provide more details but just the thought of the memory makes me feel a little better inside.

I'd love to hear from you guys, and of course please feel free to add as much or little detail as you'd like

Edit: guys this seriously made my day. I'm gonna go through them one by one each time im sad, thank you so much :')"

I won't go through the whole dream as I dont remember the beginning, but I remember quite a bit of the end. I was in a large room that felt familiar but definitely didnt recognise. I'm fairly sure that in the dream I knew I was dreaming but wasnt able to control it. There were people there who kept appearing and then disappearing, and I think they were trying to convince me that I wasnt dreaming and trying to get me to listen to them, it almost felt like they wanted me to stay. Towards the end of the dream I just kept interrupting them telling them to wake me up, I was trying to shout it because by this point I had asked them multiple times and I didnt want to listen to them anymore, but could only talk it for some reason. I kept pushing and pushing to shout and I did start to get louder. Finally I was able to scream to them to wake me up, which is when I did wake up. It turns out I actually screamed in real life, rather loudly, possible what finally woke me up? My mum came in and asked if I was okay, she had heard me talking in my sleep a little before then.
In the dream I wasnt scared of the situation or the people, it was as if I was just a bit annoyed (probably not the best word but it's the only one I can think of), like the feeling when you know someone is playing a joke on you but they keep insisting that they're not if that makes sense? 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Or does anyone know of experiences from other people?

Edit: if anyone wants anymore information on the dream and/or my general lifestyle to better find out what's going on feel free to ask."

"I was wondering for a long time since never met anybody who is or heard that it's even a possibility.

If I'm moving too fast, there's a high chance of panicking and losing grip on a situation. Once I was descending downhill on roller blades, and while everyone had no problem with it, I just felt like I couldn't manage the speed and soon crashed against border stone.

Another example is bicycling at night in the city. It just feels unsafe to accelerate too much on the (almost empty) highways, because it's easy to not notice a car and falling on an asphalt is painful. All it takes to crash is a small stone or an unexpected obstacle.

Couple of months ago I went karting with my friends and just couldn't press the foot pedal all the way because it's SCARY. Overall I somewhat adapted and wasn't even the last. The event made the fear a bit less prominent, but it seems like going face-to-face with it doesn't solve anything.

That's why I'm never learning to drive, go snowboarding or try a big rollercoaster.

Bicycling is great, skiing is, too. Airplanes, society, mirrors, dogs, darkness, etc are fine. But this speed thing is just stupid. It's not even a physical object.

I discussed it once with my therapist, but the thing seems to be quite complicated and I didn't get much information about it. Other than that, not sure there's any extra fears. So I'm interested if anyone has similar experience, and if yes, why. Because I don't know the reasons behind that phobia or whatever is right to call it"
I just got one of my dream animal crossing villagers which means I officially have half of my dream team! Rosie is going to move in tomorrow!! I’m so excited but I don’t have anyone who will be excited with me!
"mid 20s lady in boston

isn’t crumb such a pretty band? also getting into magdalena bay and i am recently realizing 2pac is wonderful and i resonate with lyrics

i got bunch of cool stuff in the mail i have a problem with online shopping and did you know amazon has super cheap 2 packs of automatic self ear piercers? something like $14"
"So the other day i was browsing the web for some more computer games. I'm getting kinda bored of the lockdown in my country and needed some more entertainment to pass the time, so I decided since I'm really addicted to my PS2 at the moment i would purchase GTA Vice City Stories and Simpsons Hit and Run, usually i'd go to the store and buy these but because of the whole lockdown restrictions i took a chance at purchasing them to be delivered at my house and oh my is it exciting! I have the Royal Mail app which can track every step of my package's progress from the sender, to my door. 

I know its nothing major but i've never really done online shopping before and i guess its kind of the novelty of doing something you've never done for the first time, who knew i could be so easily entertained in lockdown? 

TLDR: First experience at online shopping went well and i bought 2 new video games to alleviate my boredom during lockdown, i was very excited with the thrill on buying stuff online."

"I graduated in August of Petroleum Engineering, which can be hard to get a job in even when we're not at crisis like we are now, and doesn't offer a lot of stability because well, crisis means everyone is at risk. So I realize I'm not passionate enough about it to hitch my entire future in it. I want to diversify. But in what? I don't have really strong passion pulling me in a particular field's direction, I could go back to school but don't know in what and frankly it scares me a bit to think of, another 4-ish years for an undergrad in something else and what if at the end you don't like it either? Getting a masters sounds even worse, in my country it makes you basically overqualified...

"About 2 days ago I entered a giveaway on Twitter in which the 3 winners would receive a copy of Dragon Ball FighterZ on Steam. So I entered it just for a laugh. I thought it was obviously fake because my luck is terrible. So this morning I wake up at about 10 o’clock and check my notifications and it turns out I won! I was extremely giddy about it and it‘s really brightened up my day. Considering I had a load of school work to do, I’m glad that I get to unwind with a fresh new game."
"I’ve been working from home for about two months now due to COVID-19. I was sick for the last two weeks (non-COVID, they still don’t know why) and working very minimally. Today is my first full day back and I can’t find the motivation to begin working on a project. 

Does anyone have any recommendations aside from the general ‘get back into your routine’ comment?"
"Last January, I applied to be part of another department. My job for the past two years was really toxic (required overtime mon to sat for more than half a year, drowning in deadlines, manipulative managers) kinda issue. I liked what I did but it was really bad for my depression and anxiety. One of the higher leads wanted me to stay longer. 

Anyway, I got accepted and I transferred just recently. I am now a free elf!!! My work now is closer to my passions, normal work hours, and I also like my team so far. I am definitely happier now. 

Despite that, I have dreams where I'm still helping my old team out. Given the pandemic, I know work will be x times harder for them and they are constantly on my mind. Is it weird that I kinda feel bad for my previous teammates for leaving them?

Note: My teammates and I really bonded over the years given the many late nights and only having each other as support."

"I'm going to be 21 in 2 days. I don't talk much to anyone besides my boyfriend or a select few online friends. 

I wish i could post a picture of what i got in the mail because it's a yellow scarf with the pink butterfly cutie mark on each end to match Fluttershy's cutie mark from My Little Pony. The yarn strings at the end are the same color as her mane. It's baffling i don't remember giving my address out to anyone and i haven't really talked about My Little Pony or told anyone about her being my favorite pony except my boyfriend and the mail is under a woman's name. I honestly just want to know who sent me such a perfect gift so i can thank them."
"The notification said “how’s it going?” I guess I had set calendar notifications for random dates, and today was one of them. I thought about it, how is it going. And I guess I’m doing ok.

I guess I’ll ask the question that my two years ago self asked me, how’s it going?"
"I work in a typical office and every few weeks the manager puts in an office supply order. Typical things that run out quick are paperclips, pens, post it notes, tape, printer paper, ink, etc. When he orders stuff online I think hes just got in the habit of ordering a box of staples each time. The thing is, the box comes with 5 cartons of 5,000 staples each, so 25,000 staples. We do not use nearly this many. 5,000 staples would probably last months. 

But he's been ordering a box each time along with the other supplies out of habit and because they're cheap. I was just looking through a 'junk drawer' we have and there are tons of these boxes of staples. 25,000 to a box, and dozens of boxes, we have I'm sure well over a million staples. We have enough staples to last this company for, not kidding, the next 25 years."
"Feathers.

She catches feathers and brings them to me.
She wears a collar with my information just in case and there is a little small bell. It's enough noise to scare the birds away. She never managed to catch one so she brings me feathers and it's really cute.

"Hi guys,

So this guy works with me. Well to be honest he doesn't work he just go to the office. The guy never works, he just spend the day watching youtube videos or playing pokemon GO.

We work on an outsorucing company. We are from latin america but our clients are from the USA, so one requirement is to speak english, this guy cna barely speak spanish.

So whats the story? A year ago he and others friends work on another company, but we change jobs. The thing with this guy is that the company that we work right now was desperate for hire someone quickly because if not the client will close the position meaning that they will stop getting money, so they hire him edespite the fact that cannot communicate with the client and other stuff.

You know whats' funny? in our previous job the guy was exactly the same, he was always late and he was and still is looking excuse for no to work.

This guy cannot speak with client because of the language barrier so he reach a point that the client forgot that he even exits. He just array late to the office, watch youtube, play pokemon go, and call it for the day.

The worst part for me is that on that the company was so desperate for someone that they gave him a BIG salary, bigger than mine and many other people that bust our asses every day.

F**k this guy, I know that this make me a terrible person but I just want this guy to be fired."
"i may believe this is anot very comoon situation.
i was a student in work-related sencondary where eveyone goes to as a middle point to highter study camps.

in thits classroom the most popular people of class are also the most friendliest, litte fights, mostly about who buys what.

i as am student im the ""serious act to avoid posible confunsions"" becasue i have some anger poblems since childhood, im not one to talk much to anyone (exept about my dream to make videogames)  and i would say that i come as that pretty centered about my world not reality and that i look quite angry in my intent to look serious and profesional, also quite akward.

the students start get closer to take time off classes (id say that the class was and everyone seems to like me for no special reason, some just treat me like a coworker while others talk like they know me from some time) i atcully some good times whit them but it always feels weird.

some of the still talk to me even whem i not much of talker.

wanted to say that that realtioship just came of nowhere and even being part of that group just feels random and weird but in a good way even if i was on the defensive the interive time (which i belive is mot razonable thinbg to do in this situation).

just wanted to hear if anyone has pass trough that or understands it."
"So my brother (X) asked me how I would hide a USB drive from the FBI in thirty minutes, and they would search my entire property.

He said he would dismantle the dongle from a USB mouse and hide it where the dongle was.

I told him I would move the file to my computer, upload it to my Google Drive under a fake account, hide it under a ten folder path, create multiple fake folder paths, delete the file from my computer, and sign out of the fake account.

Our youngest brother (Y) said he'd hide it on the neighbor's property.

X and I are both in college. Y is starting the 10th grade.

X and I are decently smart. Y spends the majority of his time switching between watching anime and playing on the Switch (which are not truly bad when done in moderation, but he spends 75% of his time doing this, and the other 25% eating, sleeping, and avoiding chores)."
"In highschool (2016-2017) I had this classmate whom I started talking to. I had seen him in junior high aswell, but never got to talk to him due to him being more popular and lowkey intimidating. Being seated next to him in highschool was nervewrecking. I could barely speak to him during the first year (really bad anxiety😥), but the second year it got alot easier as we had projects together with some other closer friends.

He often got bored in class and would whisper about funny things he found while browsing 9gag etc., so he seemed like a really nice and fun guy (still a bit intimidating though). During the last year he went to another school than me but I did see him a few times on the bus, but we didn't talk much (just a simple ""hi"" and a hug).

Recently I began thinking about those years of highschool and how much I miss my classmates, especially the lowkey intimidating guy. I want to message him and catch up, but I'm not sure if that would seem weird. It's been 3 years after all, and we weren't close buddies or anything.

What would you guys do if you were in my shoes, or his? Would it seem creepy or weird? Any advice are welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Not sure if I should message an old classmate from highschool (3 years ago) in fear that I would seem weird or creepy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update:** I sent him a message yesterday and woke up to a reply this morning! I was expecting short, lowkey dead replies but I couldn't be more wrong. Thank you all for the encouragement!"
"In High School, I was apart of the academic team and was specialized in current events. I had to keep track of everything that could've been news from any source for around 6 months so I downloaded any news app I could think of. I have Fox, CNN, CNBC, Reuters, AP, and any other ones you might think of.

I'm finishing college now and since it was such a habit, I never deleted the apps and just get constant updates from the apps. Well in the past few weeks I started noticing a trend within the COVID-19 articles where the headline would read something like ""Scientists are thinking this date may be when the U.S. can reopen"" and it doesn't give the date or any information. It kind of looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/rWRssjT.jpg). 

I understand there is a common trope of only reading the headline but no one is that keen to read the news all day. Why would they even do this? I have no idea how to complain about this even."
"1. what's going on?
2. how has weight management been for ya during quarantine?
3. what's been your motivation to hit the day running these days?

"Well, kind of. 

You see, my father is an advanced life support paramedic in the city of Toronto. One of the most experienced paramedics in city, and he is now a training officer for the region. 

He also loves to read, and when this story took place in 2010 I just binged the first two hunger game books and the third book ""Mocking jay"" was just about to come out. 13 year old me LOVED these books and I kept badgering my dad to read them. He did, and he liked them too! We couldn't wait to get our hands in book three.

Well in 2010, the book ""Mocking Jay"" is published. It sells out like crazy. We couldn't find it for like a week because they ran out at our local book stores. My dad tells me that he will pick up a copy while he's driving around at work. 

So, near the end of his shift I call him telling him that I looked it up and there is a few copy's of the book at this one chapters location in Toronto. Well, Toronto is a big city and its really out of the way from his location but he heads down that way anyway. Gotta get that book! 

As he is nearing the book store, a call pops up on his screen. A lady in a doctor's office is choking. A thick peice of meat is blocking her airway. My dad is the closest paramedic to her, and if there was anyone that had the capability of getting this price of meat out in Toronto that day it would be him. 

He races to the office, just 15 after fire fighters arrive. He sprints into the building and yells at the fire fighters to hold the elevator. They don't. Cussing them out, he sprints up the stairs to the third floor where our victim is now unconscious. 

Now I don't remember exactly the names of the tools he used, but the way he described it was he was basically trying to hook a peice of the meat so he could pull it out. But it's just not coming out. Time is ticking and he is debating about bailing and rushing her to the hospital but he knew she would probably die if he did that so he stays and continues to work at it. Just when he was giving up hope, he manages to pull it up an inch! Then another! Then another! He fully hooks it and pulls it completely out! This freaking piece of meat was so large he couldn't believe it.

He intubates her and takes her to the hospital where she would fully recover. 

This lady probably will never know how lucky she was that a paramedic was in her area, let alone a ALS level three!

Oh and he did pick up the book! I still have it on my shelf. It's definitely a special one to me."

"For a lot of, if not all, highschoolers during this time, coronavirus has not worked in our favor. Distance learning while having to study for AP tests is quite stressful after all of our school events got cancelled. The schools new grading method is all messed up and all of my summer activities got cancelled due to obvious reasons. 

But for some reason, when the ice cream truck drove past my street, a sense of tranquility just passed through me and I smiled at the cute little tune it was playing. I ran to the open window and watched as the truck slowly trudged past my house.

The window to the room I was studying in was open as wind was blowing and I could hear the leaves rustling and birds chirping. The sky is blue today too! The chimes of the little white ice cream truck resonated through the neighborhood and just brought a smile to my face. I really don't know why it made me so happy, even if I've never bought an ice cream from them before.

But thank you to all the little things that can make me happy for no reason like this one! Covid-19 will pass if we all keep doing our part and the world can start returning to normal again. Stay safe!"
"I (26M) grew up watching New Hope, Empire, and Return of the Jedi religiously. At least one of these movies every other day from ages 5 - 9. 

While I liked the prequels, I didn't watch those on repeat like I did the originals. 

When it comes to 7 - 9, outside of The Last Jedi, I watched them in theaters a minimum of 4 times each, but once released to home theater I never watched them again. 

Rogue One I have watched countless times, so that makes the 4th movie in my rotation. Solo I've watched twice, thought it was good, but didn't have the same wow factor the second time. 

I've never watched the Clone Wars series or Rebels, but I love Mandolorian and have watched it through 3 times.

"I think I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years. 

It was at its peak in college, and I was a cutter. (I stopped my senior year because my best friend found out and made me promise never to do it again.

I never thought I needed to see anyone because I ""cured"" myself back then and because all my ""bad moments"" since have gone away within a couple of weeks.  
This past year though, I've realized that I've adopted very unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with my emotions. But I still put off looking for a therapist and making an appointment for months (probably due to the anxiety.) 

Tomorrow morning I have my first therapy appointment at 34 years old, and even though I'm super nervous, I'm also excited that I've finally taken a really important step towards healing."
"Some of the names above may have been made up.

Over the last few years, things have certainly taken a good turn if you're vegetarian (and vegan.) When I was in San Francisco, I was blown away by the Vegan options.

I'm from South Africa, it's not great but it's 100x better than it used to be even half a decade ago. It used to suck, everything was pretty much slabs of Soy shaped into various forms of meat and a McCain frozen veg patty. Suddenly there are a lot more vegans and there's a lot more options. The gourmet burger place has 2 (small) pages of vegetarian/vegan options. Fan-tastic.

Enter the fake meats and they're popping up everywhere but I'm worried we'll devolve back to just having that and maybe a portobello. I'm a lifelong vegetarian, I'm not looking to have something that kinda tastes like steak to satisfy my meaty cravings. I think I tasted the AwesomeBurger and definitely did not like.

Am I right to be worried, or overreacting?"

"My story is some 15 years ago or so. I met a girl online that lived like 800km/500miles away but we clicked and became basically best friends over the year. 
I fell in love and wanted to see her. On one day we joked about meeting in real life. I was young and foolish with no car so I took the train over night, it took me like 9hours. I just went without any musicdevice and the phone only only had the game snake on it. It was a rainy day and we arranged a place to meet I stood there in the rain it felt like for hours. Then she came and my heart jumped and I was so happy. But in the end the feeling that I had wasn't mutual. After 2 hours she left I went back to the train station heartbroken  and decided I need some music for my ride home. I bought in a store a diskman and there was a huge box of CDs of various bands. I just picked one up didn't really care which one. It was a top hits CD of the rolling stones. I get in the train, sit down and play the first song and it was [you can't always get what you want](https://youtu.be/krxU5Y9lCS8)  and  this song was basically so perfect for the moment and the time and brought a smile on my face and I thought to myself everything is gonna be alright. 
I heard the song today and it brings me exactly back to the moment where I sit in the train. I lost maybe one love but found a deeper love to music on that cold rainy day."

I don't know much about her past, only that she was at the shelter for over a year, and that her owners surrendered her because ""she grows too old"" (she's had no problems at all!). When I got her it was clear she didn't know treats (always hid them around the garden or in my cupboard instead of eating them) and was not house trained, so clearly she lived outside.

"As for me, I'm doing horribly tbh. I feel extremely guilty because myself &amp; my parents/siblings are all high risk so even meeting in a private place is a no go for me. On the verge of tears rn lol"
"You like me are worried about earth future? Just don't be! Please. Sometimes i bother myself with things i dont know about. Do you do the same?
When i hear abou ai i start worrying about the ugly future this technology can create, when thinking about climate change i worry about endless amount of species going extinct.. Etc...
What are you worrying about today? What would you say to the people like me who don't stop worrying about big themes like this?

Anyway this is a just chatting, so feel free to add about your dayly routine, etc. I for example had a pretty busy day, like i wasn't in quarantine, unbelievable, but had been a nice day overall! Your?"
Art student looking for responses.... Can you please share a memorable time that involved a puzzle?
"We didn’t do anything special yesterday for Mother’s Day. We never do in our family as we aren’t into Hallmark holidays LOL and then there’s quarantine putting a damper on things....

But it was a good day. I worked out in the morning (bench press woo) and my husband cooked dinner and I watched a silly show (total wipeout) with my 3 kids. I went to bed early, and as I lay there dozing off I could hear my kids playing hide and seek outside my room and it just filled me with this calm sense of happy peace. So nice.

They’ve been playing pretty much unlimited video games since Coronavirus started and it’s nice when they play together — extra nice when they aren’t fighting haha. 

Being a mom is hard work and I worry a lot. But it’s also the best thing I’ve ever done and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Even in this pandemic my kids are safe and happy and as scared as I get some days, that makes everything okay."
"Being on  multiple hour long live video lessons with 20+ primary school kids has been extremely tiring yet so fulfilling!!! Just today, a few of my students told me that they loved my classes and thanked me for always cheering them on whenever they got the questions right. It made me almost cry because that’s all I ever wanted to hear as a newbie teacher. I’m really pumped to be able to bring a positive change to my students and am also hopeful that this will be a job I’ll be in for a long long time! :)"
"Credit to my parents, I always try to be as polite as possible whenever I do anything. I went into a bike store to buy a new helmet, and I was a couple dollars short. The guy let me have it because he said it was nice to see someone be polite for once."
"I forgot to cancel it 24 hours in advance and I’m too broke to pay the fee. 
I’m kinda bummed because I’m too scared to go. I don’t even know why I’m scared, honestly. My plan worked, but I’m also bummed my plan worked. 

Curse my past self! They were only trying to help."
It seems like an archaic way to communicate in the age of instant messaging and slick UI chat systems. Sometimes I wonder why we still haven't left it behind...
"I just wanted to show my acknowledgment to women who do not have children but may have become caregivers. People may not tell you happy mother's day. They may tell you that you are not a mother, it isn't the same. Well, coming from someone who is a caregiver and a mother, I can tell you there are quite a bit of similarities and I know how difficult it can be. You feed them, change them, bathe them, dress them, baby proof for them... it is much like having a child/children. So for anyone out there who isn't a ""mother"" but assumes all of these responsibilities, I just wanted to say happy mother's day to you too."
"Today I made an error: My neighbor was at the door surprisingly and asked me to help him. I agreed and went to a different room to get my face protection. Only then I realized I hadn't closed the door to my home office, it was half open for several minutes. My birds had free flight and aren't allowed to leave the home office room but never actually tested it. They didn't even try to fly to the door. It made me so happy they patiently waited for their scatterbrained human to close the door before they started to fly again.

What was a nice surprise for you recently?"
"I have a lot of respect and admiration for people who've generally followed thier dreams and struggled to reach a position where they don't have to worry about surviving anymore. 

My life is personally a mess and I've always wanted to do some hobbies like learning to play the guitar or programming a game etc without having to worry about survival and money. I've never had an ambition/dream that would test my resolve in some way. My mind is pulled in tangents and it becomes a dreadful task of juggling everything, so I just drop everything difficult and move on without anything."
"When I got to the window, the guy handed me my two frosty's. Shut the window. Opened the window again, holding two frosty's. ""I already gave you your frosty's, didn't I?."" ""Yup"" 

He sighed while looking at the frosty's, and handed them out as well. ""enjoy"" and oh boy will I enjoy. 

What's the best thing that's happened to you this week?"
"Just a reminder that all laughs are beautiful because they come from happiness, and to be afraid of happiness is criminal, especially in times like these when we need it the most. Encourage laughter and share it with the people you love. Appreciate it for what it is and don’t be afraid to do it more often."
"I like hanging out at the library every now and then, it's a good way to get some cheap entertainment and some quiet.

My local library system is the Hawaii State Public Library System (HSPLS). They have 51 locations across all the islands, and a card is free to sign up for or $5 to replace. Locations are typically open in the morning and afternoon either Monday-Friday or Tuesday-Saturday, with 1-2 days per week opening and closing a few hours later. At each location they have computers which are free to use for 1 hour, but lock you out for 1 hour after that. 

Materials they have include books, cassettes, CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, newspapers, and magazines. You can borrow stuff from one location and return it at a different one. You can also order stuff from different locations to be shipped in and out of your location for reserved pickup.

There is a 25 cents per day late fee, which maxes out at $7.50 total, for each individual item. They also charge you $1 if you don't pick up reserved items or return a VHS tape without rewinding it. If your card has fines exceeding $10, you're locked out borrowing or renting anything until you return the items and/or pay the fines off.

The only downside is their odd pricing and policies. It works like this:

* Books, cassettes, newspapers, and magazines are free and are borrowed for 21 days.
* CDs are free and are borrowed for 21 days, but you can only borrow 10 at a time.
* DVDs and VHS tapes cost $1 for 7 days, and you can only rent up to 10 at a time.
* Hot picks, or books and DVDs that are brand new and in high demand, can only be borrowed for 7 days.

What do you think of this library system we have, and how does yours operate?"
"There is just a fear within me of posting images of myself bc I'm afraid people will find me.

Too many creeps on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

It just blows my mind that people post things that can lead to them being found on the internet. Especially here on reddit where you don't have a people filter.

At least you can private your IG or only friends can view your profile on FB."
"I feel so proud of myself. Fantasy isn’t a genre I tend to like a lot, and having to read Tolkien’s books felt so arduous at times. Yet, at the same time I wanted to conquer his LOTR series and I did! The ending was satisfying but left me a bit sad because I grew to love all of his characters and their personalities and roles in the books. I’m so proud of myself though, especially because I fell into a slump when I hit the last book (a lot of shitty things happened this month). I now can finally get in on the LOTR references and inside jokes hehe."
"I’ve still got two hours before I have to wake up. 

Got up to get some water and use the bathroom. Currently back in bed with my cat purring to the left of me and my boyfriend snoring to the right. I’m rubbing his back while I scratch her chin. My hand cramped but the sounds they made were so cute. Trying to decide who to turn to and cuddle to. 

I’m having a good morning. I hope this memory is etched in my brain forever"
"I have been a true single parent since my son was 18 months old. I have done it all by myself and I have done a good job. My son gets good grades and is a good kid. I just really hate buying my own gifts and planning my mother's day.   I know it seems selfish of me but I just wish I could celebrate Mother's day with a  breakfast, card or gift I didn't arrange.  Don't get me wrong I had a good Mother's Day, breakfast in bed, nice gift, quality time with my kid. Does anyone else feel this way?"
"Honestly if anyone wants to talk about literally anything, aka how HS sucks or how much you're enjoying Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing like I am, I'm here. 

I don't understand how I managed to do something so stupid lol, I hope my teacher manually marks it so I can fail a little less. Anywho Mega Chad Brad signing off until someone comments on this post."
"Rate your day out of 5 :)

My day was a 4/5. Had a slow day at work, but it was nice to see my colleagues. We had some good conversations and I feel more and more lucky I work with them. Took a long ride enjoying the sunny weather when I was finished working. Made some food, watched some Scrubs. Relaxing with some of my favorite music now. Probably heading to bed early as I've been feeling a bit sluggish all day."
"Hey guys, so this feels pretty weird. I have a mental illness, which really isn't the point of this post, but it is key context. The internet clearly figured out that I have something, as it started showing me ads for GoodRx and other prescription med services. This has been happening since I visited one of those sites. Okay, fine, they know that I take meds because they used my cookies, no big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was having a conversation about this exact topic, and for the first time in a long time I said the whole name of my illness, ""Specific Brain Syndrome"" . I almost never use the whole name, because its stigmatized and I don't like it, but yesterday I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up this morning, and damn near every ad I see says, ""Do you have specific brain syndrome? Take this medication."" I have never been a big believer in the theory that the smart speakers are listening to us, because the amount of work that would require is huge, and it seems like such a blatant invasion of privacy, but now I am not so sure. There was a smart speaker in the room, and thats the only thing I can think of. Its so weird, because I NEVER use that term  and now its following me around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on how this could have happened, or how to reset the advertisements that are shown to me would be very welcome. As i said before, I really don't love my ""Specific Brain Syndrome"", I know I have it and I'm dealing with it, but I don't need the internet slapping me in the face with the name every time I see an ad. Also, I have real privacy concerns. I feel like I can never use my computer to show someone something unless I am comfortable with sharing the personal details of my mental illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be very much appreciated, thanks for listening."
"Good day.
I was just going to ask if someone else also feels like that is something missing in their lives. Maybe it is someone, maybe something, maybe just a true passion for something, I don't know... 
Not that I feel completely empty and hollow, mind you. It is just that everything that I do, including work and hobbies, just leaves me with a feeling of ""wait... Wasn't there something really important to me?"" And even if I had really important things in the past, the feeling never really went away, just less obvious...
I really wonder if I'm missing something or it is just a weird feeling of mine.
Does someone else at least sometimes feel like that?"

I've worn the same rotation of pjs for so long because of quarantine that I'm beginning to forget what I own. Like I'll see something in my closet and be like oh wow I forgot I had this.
"I usually only post when I've got something gloomy to tell, but I'm having a surprisingly good Monday so far, so I thought I'd 'share' something positive for once.

I was in a pretty toxic relationship just a few months ago - we'd been together since we were 16, and while ridiculously incompatible, we were also dangerously codependent and (for some reason) obsessed with each other. 

It was a daily struggle.   
If I wanted to hang out with friends (which I had almost completely stopped doing for a good year of the two-year-relationship), he would get mad at me for 'favouring others over him', at the same time, he spent 98% of his time working on his web shop, myself having slowly but surely faded into the background. I was a silent onlooker, someone with the sole purpose of listening to his career plans and giving advice when wanted, while at the same time becoming a meek shadow of the person I had been at the start of the relationship.

While I knew for a (ridiculously) long time that something needed to change, I was too scared, had gotten far too used to how - while simultaneously painful - comfortable the relationship was. I knew what to look out for, what not to say, how to behave. 

Then, I met this guy. I'll cut the story short, nothing happened while I saw him then, back in the beginning of march, but he started texting me afterwords and, well, I was interested. I felt ashamed, guilty, but how *comfortable* I had felt in his presence kept me on the phone with him - again, I'll cut the story short, but we ended up in a relationship on the 20th or April (Happy 420 lol)

I had ended things with my ex about a week after meeting the guy, coming clean about a few things I hadn't told him (no infidelity) and riding out the heartbreak of the split for about a week, which, considering how scared I had always been of breaking up (thinking I wouldn't be able to 'take it') is remarkable. I had a few quiet moments where he popped back into my head atfer that, naturally, but two months have passed now and he doesn't pass my mind at all anymore. 

I'm a bit taken aback by that as well, for anyone who might think that jumping into a new relationship like that can't be healthy or sane, but I'm pretty sure I must have just been checked out of the old one for a while before the break happened. 

But the way I feel with this one (my ex is the first guy I'd ever been with like that), I can't imagine that anything that happened these months to have been a mistake - I always used to think that what I had with my ex was 'normal' - I thought that was just how relationships work, I shouldn't expect anything else, I shouldn't want anything better. 

But I've got something 'better' now. 

While I'm aware that we're still in the honeymoonphase and all that, I can't put into words just how different this feels, I can't imagine a world where I would be with my ex anymore - I can't put into words how cherished I feel in this new relationship, can't describe how loved and safe I feel, how comfortable to speak, laugh, express myself - it's the complete opposite of the relationship I had been in for the last two years and I'm so excited to fill the next two with positive memories of a happy, balanced relationship.

I honestly just can't fathom how I deserve this, haha. 

Anyway, how's your Monday going so far?"
"I’ve got a few that might make things overall easier/more doable for people while stuck at home. 

Portions are important for keeping your food stocks at a reasonable place. 

Dish and silverware sizes can also help with that. Smaller dishes will keep your portions smaller, and smaller utensils will trick your brain into thinking you’re full sooner. 

Free food always tastes good. 

You’ve probably got some books lying around somewhere. Next time you “have nothing to do”, you could give that a shot. 

Write down your ideas. Expand upon them later. 

If the news isn’t giving you any valuable information and serves only to aggravate or upset you, turn it off. 

Remember that game you started a while back and got halfway through? Why not try to finish it?

Find yourself getting more agitated at the people you’re “trapped” with? Try to remember that they’re “trapped” with you too. We’re all going through this together. 

Want to start working out? Do what you can on day 1, and work up from there. It’s a long process, but it’s definitely beneficial in the long run. I started lifting a 15 pound dumbbell we’ve had lying around for a few years and in about 2 weeks I’ve gone from 20 curls to 45 before having to switch arms. 

What have you figured out or been told that’s made things easier for you?"
"Hey,

My friends and I are trying to plan a surprise farewell party for our best friend, whose leaving. But, we’ve been trying to come up with ideas for it, do you’ll have any ideas?"
"Here's my list:
1. Late night study with songs blazing in ears
2. Sleeping through a storm or just lying in my bed with lights off during a storm
3. Bookstores and stationeries
4. Buying random shit from streets with my homies
5. When I touch a cat and it just melts
6. Hugging my mom
7. Seeing wholesome interactions between strangers
8. Unexpected compliments from unexpected people
9. When someone starts giving me attention and I start making up whole scenarios with them in my head
10. Scented candles and essential oils

I'll be happy if you share yours too! :)"
"I kind of feel bad for this, but I really like quarantine. I don’t have to physically go to school and I don’t have to hang out with people. Not that I hate my friends or anything I just really appreciate my alone time. Does anyone else feel like this?"
"This includes those whose mom's are in jail, those who's mother's are deceased, those who got separated from their mom because of the government putting them in detainment camps near the border, those who are orphans, those whose mom's left them, and those that have and see their moms every day, but they don't have good moms and might need someone else in their lives to be that mother figure. Let's take a moment of silence."

"Try it on someone your close to or on yourself, by Googling for example ""what characteristics does an Aries born in the Year of the Dog have?"" And you will be shocked on how accurate it is."
"I always used to feel bad about myself, I still do, but now it's much better. I finally have a goal in life. My family doesn't approve of the goal, but still, it doesn't matter. When I achieve it, they'll realize they were wrong and they will be proud of me. I just wanted to share this story with this beautiful subreddit and I feel good today. Thank you."
"I have a bad habit of trying to play multiple video games(not at the exact same time but you know what I mean ). The campaign mode on a lot of the games I have are like partially finished. The sad thing is that I have several other games that I am thinking of buying for my PS3 . Yeah, I’m cheap so I still never upgraded my gaming lol. Anyway, I am gonna try to get better about getting the most out of my games and finishing them but just wondering if you guys have the same problem"
"I was listening to spotify, and a song came up called Form Follows Function by Lupe Fiasco, the whole song was good, but there was a line that I found very clever, ""and they sink in the same sea that we walk, Not that we Jesus we just don't wait 'till it thaws"". I just really wanted to share the line, because I thought it was good, so I decided I'd share here."
"Hey everyone hope you all be just fine as I try to...
I'm a Mexican 20 years old boy (living in Mexico) having a very ordinary life (and glad about it) but since I was a child all I really want to experience in this life is to ""go nature"", I meant I'm just feel an special devotion 'bout nature and I find such a unique comfort in Loneliness (sometimes, most of the time).

Due to the reality in which I had to be born and with which I struggle day after day to change (but it seems impossible) that motivating and hopeful feeling  it's turning into frustration each day that pass.

Maybe it's just because of my age, but honestly, I don't have an indispensable liking to material things, and while I understand the importance of money, it's not my priority. 

I feel that I would be very happy, if I could live simply, very close to nature ... am I crazy? Should I hold on to these ideas or just accept my reality?

Thanks for hear this mad and maybe too young boy, please be honest with your answer. Stay safe!

*Sorry for my bad English I still learning."
"What if cable TV changed its structure to where you could cherry-pick which networks you want, each including live and on-demand feeds for $1/month ($5/month for premium networks), and became entirely commercial free. How enticing would that sound to you?"
"A couple of years ago my grandma’s trusty printer broke down as it was over a decade old. She phoned me up and she was anxious, as she had no idea what kind of printer to get now. Me, being 20, young and sometimes too self-centered and forward-thinking, I naturally told her that a wireless printer would be the way to go. She would be able to print documents from her phone or her iPad or her computer, all without having to connect a cable. So she bought a wireless HP printer and it was a mess. I spent days trying to get that thing to work with her devices. In the end I had to sell it for her and she bought a traditional wired printer for like 40 bucks instead. It’s been a breeze ever since. It’s a bit more of a hassle for her to email documents and photos to herself to be able to print from the computer, but it’s what she’s familiar with. She feels comfortable using this device, and doesn’t want or need the learning curve of switching to wireless technology.
 
The next christmas her clothing iron breaks down. I go to the store and get a new one that was as close to the original one I could get. She loved it. 
Today, I’m at her house studying for a final, and I notice she’s been using the same mouse and mousepad for as long as I can remember. I immediately think that a wireless mouse would be a better fit, as she wouldn’t have to worry about a cable tangling up. Nope. She’s used to this mouse and will continue to use it until it breaks down. And then I’ll go and get her a new one that’s exactly like the other one. Wired, tangly, impractical in someone’s eyes - but it works for her."
"Today is Mother's Day in Mexico. I am a 21 year old only child. My mom decided to spend the afternoon watching home videos with me and my dad, we converted them from VHS to CD a few years ago and hadn't watched them.

The CDs are hours long but we watched several clips from my mom's ultrasound to my 2nd Christmas. It was lovely to hear how excited my parents were while watching clips of me growing up. They just kept repeating how wonderful it was to have me as their daughter and how much they love me, and I feel *soooo* blessed to have them as my parents! I don't know how to explain it, I am tearing up while writing this, it's overwhelming and extraordinary how someone can love their child so much! I had a fantastic childhood and I owe everything I am to my dear parents. 

We are far from being the perfect family, in fact, we are quite dysfunctional, but today it felt as if we were indeed perfect. 

I know everyone's got different stories, but if you're lucky enough to have had a childhood full of love, take a moment to appreciate your parents and all they've done for you. I know today I have."
"Maybe it was a bit selfish of me to not at least wait until tomorrow, but in my mind I just had to come out with it as my mother had been on thin ice with me for a while, and this was the last straw. My grandfather had promised me one of his Harleys when he passed, I think he knew his time was approaching. Well, a couple years ago he left us with no will, so no way of knowing who gets what. I knew getting things liquidated and dividing assets was going to be a task that takes time which is why I was unaware of the happening until visiting today. Well, my mother thought it was appropriate to gift that bike to her new husband instead of passing it down to me like my grandfather intended. This was very depressing news to me and my grandmother (unmarried at his time of his passing so she didn’t get to choose who gets what). I felt extremely betrayed and after some asking, I also discovered she never intended for me to have his motorcycle and if she ever gets rid of it my uncle gets first dibs, but this information came after some gaslighting (which I’m used to) and her even trying to say it was my fault. So yeah, anyone else have parents you’ve had to cut out of your life for your own mental wellbeing?

Edit: Grammar"
"I have a friend at work who is going through a rough time right now, so I’m leaving her small gifts to cheer her up. She doesn’t know who is doing it which makes it fun for me. I am running out of ideas, she doesn’t like clutter, so I am trying to get things that she can use, little candies, a candle that type thing. Any ideas would be appreciated!"
Or suggestions for a new show would be nice. I am trying Community out and have watched most of Recs and Park so something besides those would be nice.
"Hello,  i went for a bike ride to the train tracks near my house to take some pictures. I took a picture of this cool, graffitied post above the train tracks. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1562o2MHF2JFyYDC6n37hR62rsZm7m7Ba/view?usp=drivesdk

It wasnt until i looked at my pictures that i saw a face in the post. The face is on the  right hand side of the photo with white with black features. The nose is the most cleary defined to me. On of the eyes is made by a nail in the wood. 

Here is a spooky edit i made

"I’m a 19 year old girl and I just finished my freshman year of college. I’ve thought for years about shaving my head just for the freeing feeling and change. I’ve also heard so many girls saying you should shave your hair off at least once in your life. The problem is my parents, I’m living at home until the fall. Both my parents are conservative/traditional and seem to expect me to have “girlish” hair. I know they’ll still love me, but idk how I’ll feel if they treat me differently because of my hair? Or lack thereof. Generally I just do things (piercings, tattoos etc) without telling them because I’m so scared of what they’ll think. Mostly they just make comments and I’m never confident enough to stand up and tell them I really like it. I feel like my happiness is all that should matter, but I also want my parents to approve. Where’s the balance?"
I feel guilty saying it as so many others are suffering but I have been benefiting from this pandemic. I started work recently doing delivery and people have been so much more generous with tipping. There is little to no traffic on the road which makes my job so much easier. I have social anxiety so going out shopping has been so much better with less people. I love wearing a mask out in public because it gives me more anonymity which helps my anxiety as well. I love to be at home and don’t enjoy going out but I normally feel guilty for it since I know I’m supposed to be active. Don’t have to worry about that now since I’m actually supposed to be at home isolating myself. The icing on the cake was the stimulus check that I wasn’t even sure I was going to get. All in all I’ve been benefiting from the Covid pandemic. Like I said I feel guilty sort of saying that but it’s true. How have you all been with all this so far?
"&amp;#x200B;

In April I was in an accident.  I tripped and landed on a curb, it was awful!  Busted lips, broken teeth,  sprained hand fractured jaw and a nasty concussion.   Yes, I basically curb stomped myself!  Yes I was was sober,  I am just very klutzy.   It was horrible and ridiculous because it was such a stupid accident!  I was also at work so it was humiliating.  I had oral surgery and they pulled the teeth and did a bone graft.  I am healing and getting better every day.  

Thanks to Corona I cannot get in to see a dentist, to get flippers and because of the jaw fracture I have to wait 7 month to get dental implants.  Really fun stuff!  (At least I am wearing a face mask when I go out so no one can tell, so there is that!)

I bought a giant artichoke today and steamed it.  Only after I had prepared it and butter to dip it in did I remember that I have no teeth!  

I am laughing and think it is hysterical but I live alone so I needed to share..."
"That truck was the first car that's been in my name. before that I rode motorcycles, and drove my parents cars. But that little truck was a new kind of freedom. I put a camper shell on the back, a bedrug in as well, and took it camping and offroading every chance I got. That truck got me into and out of a fair few sticky situations in the dirt.

Unfortunately, the cycle of wheel it/break it/fix it/wheel it isn't too nice on the wallet, or my time. So when it was relegated to the streets, it became harder and harder to justify having such a thirsty vehicle. And here we are.

I've been thinking today about how the memories I had with that truck aren't really mine alone. Every scratch and dent is a record, without which all I have are senses and feelings that will fade over time. Likewise, those dents and scratches only have meaning to me, not to the nice couple that bought the truck. They know that the pinstriping down the doors can from a trip to Joshua Tree, but they don't know how that thin, overgrown trail was hiding a huge ditch that scared the hell out of me when I unsuspectingly put a wheel in it, lofting the opposite corner. In the end, the pinstripes weren't the important part. It's just the part the new owners saw.

I am going to miss that truck, in fact I already do. But it's better in the end, for me and for it. Well, better for it in the sense that a vehicle gets to serve its purpose. And for that I'm happy. 

Plus, the money doesn't hurt."
"Today was a lot of instruction manuals. A lot of stuff was ordered lately and today was the day.

1) Ordered a new headboard from Wayfair, our old one fell apart. Today was the day I put it together and attached it to my bedframe. I've put a lot of shelves etc together, this was probably the hardest just because the pieces were big and heavy.

2) Put together a lawnmower received yesterday and mowed the lawn. This was easy, just the handles really, but mowing the lawn was tough even with a brand new blade. It should have been mowed 3 weeks ago 

3) Got a new office chair and put that together. In between the lawnmower and headboard in terms of difficulty. Pretty easy.

I'm terrible at this stuff so it took me about twice the time as a normal human. But I did it

Also did 2 loads of laundry, called my mom, made supper, and spent a couple hrs on the Playstation.

It's so easy to just sleep away the days off working from home/quarantining and I've been trying to snap out of it. Today was a success"
"So the other day I was on the phone to my grandma and she go’s oh yeah most awful thing happened today. “What happened?”. “Well I went in my mailbox and you know what there was!”. I was expecting snake/spider/scorpion and I say what was it. “A parcel, there was a parcel in my mailbox”. I was a little confused at this point and she continues her story. “It was from China” she says. Now it’s making sense, she’s lovely but... misinformed to say the least. I asked “what did you do” because I wasn’t Ed to keep hearing what happened. Here’s what she did in order. Puts on gloves and a dust mask (just rubber gardening gloves), picks up the box, puts it on the lawn, hoses it for about 5 minutes straight, pours disinfectant all over it, leaves it to dry. She then takes off her mask and gloves, seals them in a plastic bag, puts that bag in another bag, then disposed that bag. 45 minutes later and a new pair of gardening gloves and a mask, removes the contents of the box, puts it on the lawn, hose then disinfectant all I’ver the contents, leaves it for 45 minutes, finally takes it inside. Later that day she went to a shopping centre without any safety precautions. I love my grandma but I couldn’t help to share this"
"I gotta say, the storytelling of old time gangster movies are superb. The movies know what they are; crime dramas. The pacings, although slow and steady, are perfect. All of these movies are near 3hrs long, but they always somehow manage to keep your eyes on the screen. It's no wonder these movies are referenced and spoofed in other films. The lines and events are just so memorable. However, they are not the same. I like the goal of reforming the Corleone family business in the Godfather Trilogy and how dramatic music scores and violence is reserved for important scenes. I also like the realistic, gritty nature of the characters and setting of Scarface along with the ultraviolence that suits the two. I have yet to see Goodfellas as I hear that it's the best gangster movie out there."
"What kind of content (minecraft related) do you like to watch on youtube? Im starting a channel and I would like to know what some people like. Since I started coding plugins a few weeks ago I think that can be my main thing, but I would appreciate any suggestions"
"Hey guys! I am pretty new on Reddit, but I really love it so far! Met some nice people in this forum, and since we are in a hard time, I just want to ask if everyone is safe and okay at home. I hope you are washing your hands regularly, and keeping in touch with your friends and families. I also want to lighten this up even more by asking what you are doing during quarntine, and what you are planning to do later? What are some things you like or dislike about quarntine? You can use this post to vent out any feelings you have. Again, I hope everyone is safe and okay, and I hope I get meet some great people in the comments!"
"So, my favourite earphones died. They gave out really good sound quality, so I was a bit bummed, but I picked up new earphones today. 

Unfortunately the new ones are...a bit bad. Almost like I'm listening to music from someone else's headphones? And, because of a certain virus I can't go out and return them.

So, I came up with the genius idea to rewire my headphones! I know that the bit that broke on my old headphones was around the headphone jack, so my plan is to cut 2 inches off the new headphones and connect it to the old ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I've got no idea how.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help? Or helpful subreddits?"
"Has anyone else had an increase in nightmares/sleep paralysis these past few weeks?
I’ve read a few friends who said they had an increase in these things, and the past two weeks for me, every night without fail I have some sort of nightmare or really heavy sleep paralysis and it’s all very abnormal. 
I haven’t changed anything that I do( ya know like eating or drinking different or doing that at different times) it’s all be the same...I just woke up from the worst one I’ve had in years.
I’m just wondering if any else has been experiencing this?"
"Wow, that’s a super long title. 

Anyway, I recently joined social media for the first time. I’m 18 and I needed roommates for college, plus I thought it’d be a good idea to start keeping in touch with people from high school after I graduate. 

The idea of social media makes me really anxious, which is part of why I haven’t joined it for so long. Now that I’ve made an Instagram account, I feel super weird about it. 

How do I know who to follow? Is it weird if I follow people I don’t talk to a lot but I’ve had classes with? Is it weird that I’m 18 and I only have like 30 Instagram followers because the thought of following more people makes me anxious? 

Anyway, if anyone has any advice or went through the same thing as me, I’d really appreciate it. Thank you!"
I'm knew to it and learning German A1. What language are you learning and why? I really like the German language and culture. It's very different to England's I'd say. I want my language learning to be life long. French and Italian seem like beautiful languages.
"I have been bored out my mind lately and i don't know what to do. I have beat most of the video games i own and multiplayer games (like Modern Warfare, Pubg, and GTA V) have been way too rage-inducing and sweaty lately. I have been absolutely addicted to a pilot on YouTube called Hazbin Hotel. So much to the point where I'm working on making a recreation of it in Minecraft. The only problem is that I'm kinda stuck on it. It's not like I only have a couple of games, either. I have a Nintendo Switch as well as an xbox with almost 150 games on the xbox. I think its just come to the point where I'm gaming so much Im geting bored of it insanely fast. I have a feeling like games are more boring now to me, even if i usually play the game for several hours without stopping. Can you guys give me suggestions for things to do or advice so i can keep my sanity? Thanks so much in advance, and i hope you all are staying safe and healthy."
"I used to be very open minded as a kid and loved talking my family and friends remember this talkative kid and so do I but now i just can’t start or hold conversations with my family, friends, or new people there’s is only one person I talk to and I’ve know her since 6th grade and whenever she asks about my friends I tell her an exaggerated story as if I have many friends and with my mother and older sister I’m afraid it might be antisocial personality disorder or that I’m lonely I’m not sure I just feel like crying"
"I mainly started it because I wanted to improve the speed at which I write cursive and my style of cursive, but it has become so much more than that. 

I only have 2 friends I talk to on a weekly basis, so writing down what has gone on in my day, my anxieties, and whatever else may be on my mind is such a relief. 

I’ve just been overall happier since doing it. I can write out how I’m feeling in the moment so I can get over any negative feelings quicker"
"I will pick up my phone to turn on a light and instead open Reddit and a half hour later I’m sitting in the dark browsing prequel memes. Other times I will ask Alexa what the weather is, then proceed to not listen for the next 40 seconds and have to ask again. 

Anyone else have this crap happen all the time?"
Crying in the shower sucks because water gets in your nose and you start choking and you start choking instead of crying and then it just hurts instead of letting out your emotions does crying anywhere else hurt? I can’t think of any.
"Sorry for the long post. I don't have anyone to tell these things to so I'm telling my fellow redditors. 

I don't have any friend here in the US. My speaking and writing skill suck. English is my second language and I'm simply a foreigner when talking about American sport, politics, history or culture. Sometimes I have a break down and wonder why I always have to try so hard and work so much and want to give up so bad but I just can't and I won't allow myself to, because I know the moment I let go, every effort my parents and I have made to get me to this point of my life will be wasted.

A little background of me: I'm a trans guy, Asian, not tall or good looking or good at math or at anything. I came from a lower-working class family and had a terrible childhood that full of depression and suicidal thoughts. My parents always fighting to the point that I'm happy that they're divorced now, but they love me and I love them so no worries. I was sexually harassed a few times as a kid but never told anyone because no one would care. I managed to survive 12 years of school and never want to go back. I went to a shitty college to study a shitty major and failed the first year because I was an ass who got drunk 7 days a week.

But hey that was back in the third world country. I came to the US 3 years go. I'm currently 23 and 2 year into college, and have been sober and working so hard (+40 hours a week) for 3 years straight trying to make a living while still managing to keep good grades. I live with my dad to take care of him cause he doesn't know English (my mom didn't come to the US cause they were divorced). I bought my own car, pay for my own expenses and share the bills and rent with my dad. I take 4 classes per semester and work two jobs, one at a restaurant cause it makes decent money and another job at school to put on my resume. I clean the house everyday and exercise to overcome my depression. Sometimes I have anxiety but my dog calm me down. I started reading not too long ago to relax and improve my English. 5 years ago I was an ignorant asshole with nothing in my head and my hands and now I have something and it feels like a great achievement and wonder if my parents feel proud of me for this. It's not much but it's honest work.

I was driving home today and suddenly realized that having so many disadvantages in the past is my best advantage. It taught me to work hard, to understand the value of my hard earn money, and to appreciate and love my family more, and keep my feet going. I don't complain about anything anymore, and when I do, I think about those currently in worse situation than mine and stop. I get to go to college, have a place to live, a car to drive, a job to pay bills, and thankfully my parents are still with me. I have a 10 year plan of working my ass off so my parent and I can retire and live their life comfortably and financially secured. I know it won't be a smooth ride ahead but I hope it won't get to rough. What's past is past and I'm currently very happy with what I have and I think you should too.

Life gave me a lot of lemons and I'm squeezing the hell out of it.

Thanks for reading!"
"Sometimes I’ll have a lot of extra money on the side (which is good I guess lol), but I get the urge to game and end up not finding something that I want to play in my library, so then I look in the stores and once again end up not finding anything that catches my eye to buy. 

So, I end up just sort of staring at my screen thinking if there really isn’t anything for me to play until I eventually just turn off my PC/system.

It’s so sad lol"
"I've always wanted learn Japanese, as I love everything about Japan, i find their country to be beautiful and rich with culture, the only thing that's been holding me back is how difficult it is going to be, but on day 1 I can officially say I'm making good progress! It's always been my dream to visit Japan and truely understand their history, and overcoming my first challenge is giving me a ton of hope and I just wanted to share this with somebody!"
"I have friends where if I need to reach them quickly they’re more likely to answer me if I ask them on Snapchat or Instagram than actually texting them. I don’t understand this, like why when you see a text notification on your phone do you not check it before a Snapchat notification. If someone is texting me I’m much more likely to read or answer a text before opening snap."
"I’m wondering what the rest of you think. For those of you who married young, what are the positives and negatives about it?

For those who waited, are you glad you did? Would you do it any other way?

I’d like to enjoy my twenties independently, but will that suddenly change in my thirties? Did you all ALWAYS want to be married, or did it happen one day?"
"My family has raised 11 puppies from the start of quarantine, and managed to sell every single one! Leaving day is Wednesday. 

They’ve bitten my fingers, released all sorts of bodily fluids on me, ruined my sleep schedule and, as stated before, my shoes are sacrifice to the dog gods. 

But damn if they aren’t man’s best friend"
"It's carpal tunnel release surgery. I've actually had 2 other surgeries before and when they were about to put the IV in that's when I stated panicking, then I started crying uncontrollably.. I had a full blown panic attack and it was almost like I was watching myself have it because I can't even control the reaction. It was super embarrassing and the doctor and extra nurses didn't even react really and just watched me, I just felt judged/even worse. The IV freaks me out as well as the anesthesia and anticipating going under. 

Can anyone offer me any reassurance or say anything that might help me feel more at ease? I know I'll probably end up crying and hyperventilating but I wish it wasn't so embarrassing too D:"
"Think about how people are so superficial to each other, are quick to judge, and follow untrue stereotypes. Obviously there are many other issues, but these are just a couple examples to help you think of some. 

If you'd like to elaborate on those ones above, please do

What do you think we can do as a society, or as individuals to stop these issues from ruining one of the most fundamental aspects of being human: social interaction?"
"So I’ve been delivering for a florist the past 5 years (seasonal holidays). I love my boss, she’s always been so appreciative of my help, pays me a little extra cash, and even gifts me an arrangement to bring home to my mom each time.

So I (21F) just worked the past 3 days doing deliveries and we shoveled everything out so we didn’t have to work Mother’s Day. My boss said she might need me the following week because she was so busy. I said sure give me a call whenever.

So today I get a call from her and I think she had a brain fart lol 

Boss: hey OP! Happy Mother’s Day! I mean future Mother’s Day because you’re not pregnant but hopefully one day you will be! 

I giggled 

I wished her a happy Mother’s Day too and said I’ll be there to work this week."
"I (17M) work in a fast food place in my hometown.  I love my job,mostly because of the fantastic managers and crew who I get to work with.  I had a traumatic school year in 2013-14 which sent me into depression for a while.  A year or two later, I beat it, and I'm a super cheerful and upbeat guy now.

On thursday, one of my coworkers who I'll call Tess (not her real name) spent most of the shift doing one of the hardest parts of the job (running for drive through if you work fast food) and, as usual, she was getting a little stressed out.  Perfectly normal, happens to literally everyone when they're in that spot.  I was working one step down the figurative supply chain from her, and I frequently tried to say ""Thank you"" or ""Great job, Tess! You're doing awesome!"" to help keep her from getting discouraged.  She has been working there longer than me, but after a few days of encouragement like that, when she was leaving she said ""I don't know what I would do without you, lifting me up like that.  It feels so good."" I'm glad I'm helping her and it also helps me feel accepted there.  I've been there since summer and I'm no longer a new guy in any sense of the word but still.

On Saturday, a different coworker (let's call her Sierra) was working a different spot and getting a little bit stressed.  I told her that she was doing a great job, and that I was proud of her and how friendly she is when she interacts with customers (I trained her on some of the stuff there) because she was getting frustrated.  When I asked if she was alright she said she was just in a bad mood but she was fine.  Things slowed down a bit and I said ""It's okay to not be okay.  You don't always have to be bubbly and cheerful.  I know you have issues, and I know what you're dealing with... I just wanted to remind you how awesome I think you are and how well you do your job."" It made her smile and she was in better spirits all night.

What do you do when your coworkers are stressed?"
"Things were going pretty well for a little while, considering, you know, the world crumbling in front of our eyes. But my situation changed drastically in the last couple of days and this person I always looked forward to talking to also drastically changed the way they interact with me.

So I’m trying not to think about it.

What are you trying not to think about? What are you doing to avoid it? What’s a good meme you saw today?"
I was just wondering. As I get older (I'm 30F) its getting harder to maintain a flat stomach when I love to eat ha. Just looking for opinions.
It's been kind of a slow day for me today. It's 2 o'clock right now and it feels like I've been awake for two days already xD. I am kinda bored right now but don't have energy to do anything. Kinda tired. How about you guys? What have y'all been upto today? Anything interesting? Hope you are having a great day :)
"Me and a couple of my friends were hanging out and playing with b b guns. A person in our class who we really don't like and is kind of an asshole walked over to us and basically demanded that we give him a b b guns. We refused, so he turned to me and tried to grab it out of my hands. As we were struggling, I pulled out the magazine, mostly by accident. He finally managed to grab it away, pointed it at my face, and trying to be dramatic, pulled the trigger. The gun clicked. I smiled, and held up the magazine. Everyone went nuts. I felt amazing."
"Anyone else feel like they just end up on your phone on facebook and Instagram without fully realising?
Like I'll just flick between the two even tho im MEGA BORED of it and then just think ""wtf am I doing I better get on with some real life stuff"". 
But I still have an urge to go on them, anyone else the same? 
Weird, huh?"
"So in my district, we have quarantine passes that indicates each individual's schedule as to when they're allowed to go outside. There was this pregnant lady who was barred entry from the grocery because her pass didn't allow her to be out on Saturdays. 

She came up to me and asked if I'd be able to help her buy milk and diapers for her 1 year old and offered her cash. I was hesitant at first because... I've never bought baby formula and diapers before!! But she indicated the exact brand and diaper size she needed, so I told her I'd help and try to get the exact items. 

The baby formula was pretty easy to spot so I had that good to go, but the diaper brand and size she needed wasn't available and so I subsituted with a different brand. Got the size right though. 

She was waiting for me outside the grocery and I could tell that she was very concerned that I may have ran off with her money 😂😂 Handed her stuff and change and told her to check her schedule next time so she wouldn't have to travel for nothing! 

That's it. That's the story. Have a good day, everyone 😊

TLDR: Bought milk and diapers for a pregnant lady who was barred entry in the grocery."
"And it’s adorable! She’s laughing all the time and trying the silly pranks (even if they’re so old and predictable).
It’s so nice to see her smile and laugh at something I normally find so cringey!

Has your parents habits or humour shown more in this lockdown time?

Hope all your mum/dads/parents/carers etc are doing good in this mad time!"
"It’s a small pad thing that I don’t use that often but sometimes to ease back pain.

I just had it under my shoulders and upper back laid on the bed. I felt a hot pain in one area that eventually made me leap up and off it. It was glowing orange and then a corner burst into flames!

I put it out quickly and it’s now unplugged downstairs. It burnt a hole in my favourite fleece, that must haven been happening before i noticed!

I have no reason to believe it hasn’t passed safety checks or whatever, maybe was getting old, but damn, that was scary!

I’ve never fully trusted those things."
"Both during my time as an alcoholic and after (I suppose I always am one but..) I have always wished I had more ""feels"" or ""vibes"" when entering a bar, tavern, hangout spot, etc. in a video game. I dont know if I'm explaining this correctly but I'm always dissatisfied when I enter a bar in a video game and I cant figure out why. I guess like in Skyrim I'd enter a tavern but have to do something else in the mission and/or I'll order a drink but not feel like I feel when I order a drink in real life. I just wish there was a better way to catch those ""feels"" in a game the same way you do in real life. Like the feeling you can meet anyone with an interesting story or cuteness while holding an intoxicating drink. But instead your surrounded by the trappings of the game and wow....I really dont know where I'm going with this. I'm sorry. How's your quarantine?"
"A few months ago I bought a new brand of shampoo. I HATED it. It dries my hair so much, and makes it feel very heavy. The smell is not awesome too. But I didn't want to throw it away, so I just kept using it.

I am finally getting to the end of the bottle. Today after I washed my hair I noticed it feels so light and soft, and not dry at all. I guess all of the stuff that makes your hair not get dry stays at the bottom of the bottle, so you need to shake it before use to kinda mix everything together? What the fuck."
I feel like I’m learning a lot about myself during this time ... most of all that I don’t need constant activities to make me happy. I’m curious to see what others have learnt about themselves during this strange time!
"I’ve always just shaved off any hair that grew on my face, but I let my little bit of chin hair grow out because I didn’t feel like shaving it, and since we’re locked in it’s no big deal. But seriously, having that little bit of hair on my chin is so irritating for my face and it made me wonder how other guys have full faces of hair lol"
"I’ve been thinking about this recently because I want to start eating healthy and working out again. I know the usual advice people give is to start out with small steps, and work your way up so you don’t lose hope or motivation too quickly.

But has anybody actually done something completely cold turkey and have it actually work out?

I actually have been able to do this. I (21F) became vegetarian my freshmen year of college, and am still vegetarian 3 and a half years later. I also am not planning on stopping this anytime soon. The only thing that might change is that I plan on becoming a stricter vegetarian as time goes on.

Now the reasonings for my diet switch is another story, but the point is that one day I literally just stopped eating meat and that was that.

I never thought about switching back, I never told myself “oh just one chicken nugget wouldn’t hurt” or “I’ll just eat this burger because it’s a family outing and there’s nothing else to eat”. No, I literally just cold turkey stopped eating meat.

(I do have to mention, I’ve accidentally eaten things that was made with chicken broth, like certain Mac &amp; Cheese, and have eaten jello and marshmallows. But as soon as I found out about those things, I stopped eating them) 

This is the only thing that I have done cold turkey and I think it’s because of my passion or reasoning for it.

Like I said at the beginning of this post, I want to start eating extremely healthy and working out, and I want to get on a strict schedule immediately doing so cold turkey. Over the years I’m always on/off about being in shape, and I feel like it never sticks because of my slow steps and it taking forever to work.

Has anybody had any luck with doing anything they wanted to do cold turkey? (Doesn’t necessarily have to do with working out/eating right)"
"I just finished up cleaning my window wells and the back area of my apartment building, but didn't expect to be doing the latter. I initially went outside to clean the wells but the dumpster area looked awful too, so I ended up picking up as much of the litter as I could. I'll give it like a week to get back to how it looked but I'm glad that it's nicer now. 

How has your day/week been?"
"Good god, it's like the entire internet had the bottom fall out it and took the entirety of the content with it. Nowadays, it's almost like only the top 20 sites from the last 10-20 years even exist anymore; plus opinion media and retailers.

Where do you even view anything else anymore? And how on earth did they strip creative, independent content practically off the face of the web?"
"It can be extremely stressful where I work so I love going outside and walking for 30 minutes. My friends think it’s kinda odd since we spend a lot of our time on foot anyway. The purpose of the walk isn’t to exercise though, I just love being outdoors and hanging out with the cats that live behind the hospital."
"A book, a gesture, something that was said to you, anything really. Having a pretty crappy day; could use all the positivity on the internet. No troll please!"
"I've been working on a final exam lately, and one of the  subjects I decided to work on is ""interpersonal communication"". I did it in one week, finished two days ago and today a classmate asked me how can she starts to do  this thing. We've worked on this for about an hour (it's 11:28 pm right now here in Italy) and just finished. I've been a pretty shitty person lately, so I don't expect to receive any ""thank you"", but when I finished to help her she sent me an audio where she just said ""thank you, Amir, thank you"". I almost broke into tears because it's been a while since someone told me this, but it was the best moment of my day."
"There was this guy I was in marching band with. His name is Bradly and he was dating one of my friends. He’s generally well liked, funny, handsome, talented. Good guy overall. But he had a really weird habit and I’ve never seen or heard of anyone doing it since. 

He would just randomly fall over, straight backwards, with his head tipped back, onto any surface (grass, tile, concrete, carpet) at any random time. It was like a party trick to him because everyone was impressed that he could do that without flinching and seemingly without hitting his head. Other kids tried and failed to emulate it, all of them ended up concussions, or cuts on their heads. You know like a normal injury one would get from flinging themselves backwards onto concrete with their head tilted back. Somehow Bradly was completely unaffected by it. 

I always thought that maybe it was one of those things where everyone has the one kid at there school that’s just like that. Like so many people seem to know a girl who would walk the mile in gym class wearing Cookie Monsters pajama pants, and Osiris shoes. Every school has one super quiet girl who reads books about horses. Every school has the boy who teachers always told not to tilt his chair back but he does anyway and then one day he falls and cracks his head on the floor. 

I always assumed that every school had a boy who would recklessly fling himself backwards onto his head. As I’ve thought about it I really wonder if other kids actually did that or if Bradly was truly one of a kind."
"It's 6 am over here rn and I just finished the first season of jojo and honestly oh my god I love that show so much. 
I'm contemplating if I should go to sleep or not because that's time I could use to watch jojo instead!"
"Good day to everyone!

Where I live, it’s currently warm, sunny and there is no wind (for a change!). My wife and I are spending it outside versus being cooped up in the house. 

I hope that everyone has solid Sunday Funday."
"Been in a funk lately, and kinda want to know what you folks do to take your mind off shit and change your outlook. I tend to pull away from my reality, which never helps lol. I'm open to just about anything."
Hi my name is Mia and I am 13! I just moved to a new school and I was hoping to get to know people from my area or just in California. I am from Colorado and I am looking for someone to show me the ropes of California because it is really different here. Can't wait to meet some new friends!
"I’ve been seeing a lot about people who wanted to have a quarantine glow up or learn a new language or renovate their home since we just have so much time to ourselves now. But honestly, that’s seems super unrealistic since it is such a stressful time. People are unemployed, away from their loved ones and social support, and we are just thrown in this situation. Food specifically is so easy to reach if we are the lucky ones that can afford food. We may also be eating more because we are bored. So obviously eating more can be interfering with that glow up that some of us want but there’s other times for that. 

I personally gained 20 lbs in the last two years. From stress, getting on birth control and being in a relationship. Trust me, grad school 15 +   relationship weight and birth control weight is so real. At the beginning of the quarantine, I decided that I really wanted to lose the weight and I’ve beat myself up for snacking. I recently started noticing that I’ve slipped into really negative mindset about food. I would get in phases of restrict and binge. Food is fuel and we shouldn’t be punishing ourselves for nourishing our bodies. I ended up losing 4 lbs since my last weight in by just adding extra exercises and letting myself eat when I want in a certain time frame. I only eat between 12 to 8! Restriction does cause extreme hunger. I’m not happy with my body yet but I’m getting there. But I’m super happy with my mindset. I hope everybody is getting there 

So be nice to yourself if you’ve gained weight during the quarantine or if you haven’t lost the weight you planned to lose. It’s okay we have so much time after quarantine to lose the weight. We don’t have to wait for a quarantine or January 1st to do so :)"
"Growing up, I saw their skull logo on the vests of sketchy characters, Glenn Danzig being intense and standoffish in every interview, and thought they were probably pretty crazy like GG Allin or something. 


I finally listen to them and I see the devilock hair, them singing the Monster Mash, Jerry Only being a friendly old stereotypical Italian. The Nardwuar interview. 

Still love them but not what I had in mind lol"
"Happened just now and I don’t know why but I just feel happy about it.

I was scrolling through my feed and I saw a post that one of my friends that I haven’t talked to in about a year might like so I sent it to him. He replied shortly after and we just started having a conversation about anime and manga that we liked. It felt nice that even though we haven’t talked for quite a while we could still hold a natural conversation like we used to. It was only short but I still felt that it meant a lot to me that someone would take some time to just have a chat."
"I just feel like when you are in a group of people, at some point or another, the topic of somebody the group/a person in the group doesn't like will come up. I think as a whole, the group will agree or add more to the topic, even if they don't necessarily agree. I think people will put their morals/values aside a bit more when they are in a group of people they love and value. Maybe it's in part to the fear people have of disagreeing with their peers and being ostracized. I don't know. But I really don't like gossip/negative talk about other. I've tried to make it a conscious effort in my life to avoid it because it just puts more negative energy into the world. Because of that, I've noticed my friends will think I'm being judgemental of them being judgemental. Honestly, it's not even that I'm judgemental of them. They can say and act how they want, it's just a personal choice to not try and talk negatively of others when they aren't around. After that, it feels like a wall becomes put up, like I'm not as much a part of that group anymore. I feel like I'm just in this weird limbo of friends all the time because of it. Maybe being a part of a friend group where you are fully a part of it just has to have that aspect. Just as people bond over things that excite them, maybe it's an equal bond over things that annoy them. I don't know. I just feel like staying steady in my morals and beliefs has always kept me at bay in a friend group."
"My mom has really dry skin on her hands due to her work and we can’t find *any* lotions that really help. The current increase in hand washing isn’t helping either. 

Her skin splits along the cuticle and takes forever to heal. She’s tried everything from standard lotions, to things like Working Hands, and even some sort of glue. 

Does anyone have any lotion they can recommend?"
"

I have mental and emotional issues. I was diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and other disorders.
I have low self esteem, anger issues, and I tend to hold on to grudges easily and for a long time. 

But another thing that impacts my mental health and week being is my thought process and beliefs. 

You see, I currently don’t have ANY friends at all. And I choose to not make any and I purposely isolate myself for long periods of time. 

My problem isn’t anxiety. 

The reason is because I feel like going out of my way make friends feel pathetic because I feel as if I’m looking and ‘needing validation from other people and I’m letting them ‘decide’ my worth. They can either reject me or accept me and be friends with me. 
I rather have people approach me and talk to me.

And another reason why I isolate myself is because of my weird and unobtainable desire to be “special” and unique. I feel like hanging out with people will make me just like them. Average and boring. I wish I could be more than average. I wish I could Stand our from the crowd in a good way. 

However despite all of this I still feel lonely and a desire to have friends and a social circle. I often fantasize about meeting people in anime conventions because I love anime. 
People from anime conventions seem so friendly and fun to be around. I fantasize about hanging with them and talking and having fun and supporting each other and having each other’s backs if something were to happen to us. 

But my personal views keeps me from talking to people. 

So I’d like to ask your opinions on what i said. 
And is going out of your way to meet people pathetic?"
"Not sure if I’m a little ashamed or proud of my odd new bubble bath habit, but it’s probably the best idea I’ve had throughout quarantine thus far. 

If you were lounging in the same manner, what comfort food would you be eating and what show or movie would you be watching?"
"I usually know at least graduates every semester, but this year I know many who are graduating (and I'd be one of them, but my required minor is not holding me back a semester) and I wish I could shake their hand and say ""congratulations"" like I always do. Of course, I'm still able to congratulate them through texts or on their Facebook posts, but it's just not the same as being able to do it in person.

I know it may sound a little self-centered, and I know that they probably have it even harder by not being able to attend an in-person ceremony, but still, I really wish I could meet my friends in person, give them a nice handshake, and tell them how great it was to have them as part of our school."
"I natively speak Persian but grew up in Pakistan learning English and Urdu; I use my computer and phone in English and while I have consumed English content dubbed in Urdu, I'd much prefer them to be in English.  

What made me come up with this question was seeing PewDiePie and other non-american youtubers using their phones and stuff in their own native language."
"Today is Mother's Day and my husband is out getting something's that will make my day. It just saddens my heart our families aren't for us. We're currently homeless living in a motel with our 2 kids. I know they're gonna have big smiles on their faces and I won't have to do anything today. Except have the thought of where are we going to be sleeping tomorrow. I don't even want to scroll and see the post on IG or FB so I deleted them days ago. I know I'll snap out of this mood when he comes back but for now I just don't think anyone is for my family and it sucks to realize that. Anywho, my day will go well I'm just going thru some emotions right now. I can't talk to FB or IG about it because I don't try enough for the fakeness of likes. So this is for the moms who can relate, their only true family is the one they created. You are just as special and loved as the other moms getting hundreds of likes."
"Credits currently rolling. 

Such a fantastic game! I'm honestly kind of sad that I don't have a game as amazing as this to look forward to playing. 

But I can fill that void by buying merch, and searching for another video game!"
"Today, in my video game, I hit many epic shots. When I pressed the capture button, I thought my xbox had clipped them, but NO! They didn't get clipped, and my shots were super good. I am not happy right now. I really hope I can hit the trickshots again."
"I get so lost in my own head sometimes, thinking about everything and nothing. This question popped in my head and I’d love to hear your happy stories, however significant or trivial they may be!"
Literally I have somehow managed to not se anyone being toxic or spewing any sort of hate here. And if there is some sort of disagreement people are usually very respectful. Using other social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram I have faced so many xenophobes/toxic people that its hard to count.
"My mom and I made the mistake of ordering to go at two different restaurants, one for food and another for dessert, for mother's day. As some of you are well aware, restaurants are EXTREMELY backed up right now. A lot of people are angry their orders aren't ready, people are crowding around to pick theirs up in this pandemic, it's a mess.

With that said, I know the workers right now are doing their best in light of a really bad situation. They're just trying to get by, do their job right, and help as many people as possible. I want you to know that it doesn't go unnoticed, and we appreciate you helping us celebrate our mom's. 

Side note: I know other fields like medical workers are getting a lot of attention right now, which is very much deserved, but I wanted to make sure these groups of restaurant workers also didn't go unnoticed. Happy Mother's Day!"
"Deep down I probably was new but never wanted to face it. I always coasted through school on my good memory, and always thought I was pretty smart and everyone around me always said the same, but now having to apply myself to do things is pretty hard. I'm scared but yet somewhat hopeful to see how far I go and break my limits."
I was a teacher for 5 years and my bachelor's is in education. I work as a legal assistant to pay the bills. I would love to work with animals now but don't want to go into debt after just paying off my student loans in education (that too me 7 years!). I'm just at a strange crossroads in my life (also recently purchased a house). Anyone else every gone through this? What helped you?
"I have a good job. My fiancé has a good job. We set up a budget and we’re trying to stick to it the best we can. Seven months ago, my car was repossessed. As recently as three months ago, we were seriously late on rent. We’re not only able to get the necessary new clothes we need, we’re able to get extras. We’re able to get nice clothes that we can wear on a night out (once this is all over)! 

I’ve always been strapped for cash. I could never really afford the expensive hair products that my high maintenance hair requires to not be a mess. I can finally do that without worrying. 

The other day, one of my employees didn’t have change for the vending machine for her break. I told her to go get a platter of whatever and I’d pay for it and we can split it. There was plenty, and even two months ago I would’ve made sure to take those left overs home. Instead, I told another employee that it was hers to take. 

Sorry, not trying to brag. This just makes me really happy. We’re finally doing okay."
"English is my second language. I grew up with American media, and thus developed an american accent when speaking. The problem is that the entire school system prefers British, so my way of speaking was considered ""incorrect"". Once upon a time I didn't have an accent, but years of being forced to mimic the British accent caused me to develop a bizarre accent which sounds like a bad Russian/Irish impression. My vocabulary and pronunciations are also all over the place. Half the time I forget to make a proper ""r"" sound. I mostly use American English, but occasionally I will also add some British words and phrases, which is embarrassing. Even worse when I use British swears, and end up sounding like an idiot.

I hate my weird accent and the even weirder way of speaking my Frankenenglish. :("
"Should I, a 22 year old guy, feel concerned that I don’t necessarily connect with my family? They’re decent people but I suppose our personalities/interests don’t align well enough to provide that sort of family connection that’s usually expected. Every time I’m with them I just feel limited as to what we can have a discussion about which leads to me just being awkward, making some type of joke, dealing with small talk or just silent. Does anyone else feel something similar to this?"
"Happy belated mothers day to all the moms new and experienced moms alike. I hope you all have great days! Its too bad its in quarentine... However that doesn't excuse all the people who have undoubtedly forgot about mothers day. I know my brothers and dad have. Why I'm giving my mom her present when no ones around! Happy mothers day everyone! Do things for your moms! Clean the house, do the dishes, cook, whatever! What are y'all doing for your moms. Or did ya forget?"
"(first things first, I'm not a Mr beast fan, nor hater)

Does anybody else find it odd, that MrBeast's editor controversy, somewhere around October 9 2019, was forgotten (in my opinion) because of the planting 2 million trees thing (uploaded in October 25 2019) am I just making conclusions, anybody else find it odd?"
"I'm sure we've all seen the posts ""even the rain wont hide my tears,"" or somebody starting a dramafest on fb. Everybody knows they're having a bit of a breakdown and watch it in real time. Afterwards the person who expresses themselves ends up cringing at what they did or said and gets really embarrassed.  But theres a case for that kind of behavior though because at least people know what's going on. If you dont say anything or do anything and just let the breakdown pass privately you end up suppressing everything and it takes a toll on you in a different way, often resulting in depression or anxiety issues. However, sometimes sharing dramatically results in getting bullied instead of just being embarrassed about it afterwards so you run that risk too if you overshare. So my question is, which is the right way? I havent been able to figure it out. Express and embarrass or suppress and depress?"
"I’ve been working for a hospital for a little over 7 months. Pre-Covid I was a financial analyst, post-covid I’ve been in completely different roles. 

This weekend I worked in a call center that we set up so that loved ones of patients can call for updates.

My last call of the day was different though. The wife of a patient who passed called because in her late husband’s belongings she couldn’t find his valuables, and most importantly his wedding ring. I said that I would try my best to find his belongings.

I knew what she was going through. When I was 14 my dad passed away and I was never given his watch. He was really into watches and had some really nice ones. When I was 12 I decided to buy a watch and gifted it to him. Even-though it was a cheap 20 dollar watch, that was the only watch he wore.

I asked my team if it’s possible that his belongings were still at the hospital. Quickly one of my coworkers told me that they can place valuables in a different place. She quickly went to look while I was on hold with the wife.

As soon as she walked in I saw her smile in her eyes. She told me that we have the valuables.

Told the wife of the patient and things got emotional. I’m beyond happy I was able to help her out. She’ll pick up everything tomorrow."
"For me it’s “if I tell the world, it’ll never be enough ‘cause it was not said to you” from Adele’s Chasing Pavements. 

Have to admit I don’t quite understand the verse in the song’s context.  For me, sometimes I catch myself trying to make myself heard in a group, but I actually just want one person to know. Or when there’s some news with only a few people I want to share it with. If others know but not them, it’s unfinished business. It makes me realize who are important in my life, or who I give priority to. And it gives me a chance to re-evaluate if the priority is proper.

Another one is “If it's not real you can't hold it in your hand, you can't feel it with your heart. And I won't believe it. But if it's true you can see it with your eyes, oh even in the dark” from Paramore’s Brick by Boring Brick. 

I think of these lyrics when assessing someone’s genuineness. Some people’s caring gestures are fake and weightless. While when you have a real connection with someone, it’s solid and palpable.

I think words are powerful and they make life more understandable. I’d like very much to know what lyrics have deep meanings to you."
"My roommate/best friend asked what I wanted to do for my birthday and I told him I didn't want to do anything, I just wanted to go to work, come home, and not do anything out of the ordinary. I don't celebrate things, and my birthday is not exception; it's not a religious thing, but a personal thing.
A couple days later, one of our mutual friends came to visit and they both made the announcement. For my birthday they want to take me camping. They both seemed really excited about it, I couldn't say no, I felt like I was cornered into the conversation. So I agreed. To be honest, I know it will be fun, but just knowing it's for my birthday makes me very uncomfortable and kinda saddens me. It's still a month away, but I'm starting to dread it. I want to cancel, but I know our friend would be heart broken. 

Have you guys ever been in a similar situation?"
"While I was giving my last exams when everything shut-down, my brother is still studying and my school has decided to take a test without even calling the students or video calling them. They expect the entire school to be honest about their answers at home where they have access to the books right there.

Even if they just video called/FaceTimed everyone it'd be a much harder task for students to cheat. Let's continue in comments shall we?"
"I have this former classmate that I follow on social media that I could only describe as “a lot”. I could elaborate but for the sake of brevity, I’ll just say that everything with her is an ordeal.

She tweeted today that she went to the grocery store and that whatever car she was driving had a handicap sign so she decided to use it and park in a spot. As she is a complainer she of
course emphasized how LONG the drive was. Apparently some woman asked her why she was using it because she didn’t seem disabled. The classmate described the woman in a very stereotypical manner (dumb/southern) and also seemed to be implying that she was being targeted because of her race. Her point was that you shouldn’t ask people if they have a disability. It got a bunch of likes, which I’m assuming people agreed with the sentiment of the tweet

I suppose I agree (I worked in Rec therapy for a while) but is everyone glancing over that parking in a handicap spot while not handicapped is a pretty scumbag move? I had a roommate in college that did this and was pretty pissed at him and this isn’t really different. Is it just because of the stereotypes she laid out that people are agreeing with her? Or are people more concerned with someone asking why another is parking in a handicap spot over someone parking in a handicap spot that doesn’t need it?"
"It's mother's day. Due to busy schedules and then this pandemic, I hadn't seen my mom in person since new years. Today, since I was at work, at a grocery store, she decided to drive over and see me. We did what we weren't supposed to do: we hugged. And I cried. I'm about to cry thinking about it. I hadn't hugged my mom since January 1st. Haven't had human touch since the beginning of March. I just needed to hug her so badly."
"I believe, by constantly worrying about the past, the future, the little things which won't even matter 10 days from now, we screw up our present.

We are what we learn from our experiences."
"(I really had no clue on which subreddit i should post this, so if this doesn't fit or if there's other subreddits i don't know yet that would fit better just let me know and i'll delete my post.)

To make this somewhat short, a few months back now, i was in a museum and, right outside the gallery, someone i've never seen and therefore didn't knew was crying, alone. I thought it was really sad (like, who would want anyone to feel so bad they would cry on a public place, especially when they're alone and without anyone to support them), and i would have liked to be able to do something to help them, not obviously something that would change everything but, just a few words, taking them out so they could breath some fresh air, or,  anything they could have wanted, really. 

But i got scared, i didnt knew if it was a good thing to do or not, if the person would have liked it or if it would have make them embarassed, maybe they would have thought it was rude for a stranger to come to them and try to help, i really had no clue about any of these things. 

So, here's my question, if you were in a similar situation, on my side or, on their side,  what would you have done ? Would you have liked someone to come and ask if you need anything and try to ""help"" you or not ? What do you think would have been the ""right way"" to act if there's one ? 

It's been a few months and i still have no clue if i did the right thing letting them alone and i feel bad about it to this day for some reason, so if any of you could help me out on that one, or give me some insight on how they would have reacted in such a situation, it would be really helpful.

Thank you very much!"
"as the title states, i find myself being less interested and impressed by television &amp;amp; movies. a friend of mine suggested i watch a four hour film claiming it had changed their life. of course i care about my friends and will watch the film, but i’ve just never found myself being super interested in watching movies. it feels like a waste of time and no matter how hard i try to get into them, i can’t keep interested. 

can anyone else relate? i feel like i’m the only who has this mindset lol"
"We see an atom with electrons and a nucleus (protons+neutrons) when we look at the smallest unit of matter. 

When we look into the sky we see black holes and galaxies revolving around these black holes with stars and planets all interlocked in a complex system. We know the universe is expanding forever and it’s difficult for us to see a clear image of the entire universe.

I’m positive that we have the potential to see more but... 

I’m just wondering (and call me crazy if you’d like) what if we were extremely smaller than the size of an electron (a ratio similar to human:sun) and we sat on top of the electron (cloud of negative energy with mass) and watched it spin around the nucleus (cloud of positive/neutral energy with mass)? 

If we were this small compared to an electron in an atom then, first we would see that the diameter of an atom is suddenly much larger to us. Would the speed at which an electron revolves around a nucleus decrease to our perception? 

What would we see? 

NOTE: I’m using sun/star and black hole as an analogy here, you could think of it as planet revolving around a star instead or a galaxy around a black hole, etc. 

Edit: adjusted some wording"
"Something I've noticed. Above a certain age every adult seems to be passive-agressive and incapable of simply *telling me* what they want or what I did to irritate them. I am 24 years old and I've yet to see the point in that. Why not just be direct? It saves time, it avoids miscommunication, and for someone like me who deals with anxiety if I've done something wrong then it's much easier to just have the bandage ripped off than to have hints dropped and then be expected to piece together that I should slowly, bit by bit, remove the bandage."

"So apparently today is my cake day, and I've never made a cake day meme post and I don't intend to, however, I will say I've been glad to have been on reddit now for six years.

I originally joined because I was really interested in the (original) H1Z1 game, when it was open world zombie survival. They had a podcast on twitch or something that was like 45 minutes long that was supposed to be a big reveal, and after that, I joined reddit so I could keep up with the release of the game.

Why'd you join reddit?"

"Today for the first time in a while at work I realized I felt NORMAL. Ive been having an anxiety attack all week with little panic attacks between. I was so happy to be back to reality I almost cried but had to hold it in. Those are the moments in life you really are grateful for little things, like just being okay or being able to think straight. I’m going to try to hold onto this moment as much as I can. When you’re anxious it really feels like the whole world is a dark place, but today i got to see it through a clear mind again and it was beautiful"
"Hello all,

I'm an Animation Student who recently figured that I should try to see as many Animated Films as possible, so as to expand my ""vocabulary"" of things I can refer to for reference, and to just be better-versed in the industry's history. You know, breaking past watching ""The Incredibles"" for the 100th time.

My focus has been to watch movies that I wouldn't normally watch, or films I might have overlooked. So far since January, I have watched 59 movies that I had never seen before (Not all were specifically Animation). Many movies I would have never found the time to watch if I hadn't blatantly forced myself to do it.

Afterwards, I love researching the movies, how they were made, how critics responded to them, and what audiences thought of them.

Rule #2 Encourage Conversation:  
\-Any film recommendations?   
\-Anyone else try to watch as many new movies as possible?  
\-AMA about my watching efforts"
I gotta post goin on /r/playdate. It might be a while afore I gets me a bite. Meanwhile any of you guys into DnD? I've been playing it A LOT since quarantine started.
"Rate your day out of 5!

My day was a 3/5. Was at my parents' place this weekend, celebrated mother's day today which was nice. Did a bit of studying and pianoplaying but couldnt get into it too much, was feeling quite restless. Now in the train home, listening to Fink."
"Happy Mother's Day people! I hope you all have a great day and find some way to celebrate this day! By seeing them, facetiming them, or remembering them I hope you all can have a nice day. :)"
"Let's talk about your day. Let's discuss music or a film. We can talk about how you feel about the whole covid19 situation tha your city or community is facing.


Basically, there is no topic too small or too large that we can have a chat about. What's on your mind Redditors?"
"When it broke I definitely knew it was broken but my friends were trying to tell me that it was just dislocated or sprained but I heard around 6 cracks and saw my ankle go backwards... not to mention my ankle was bent in a very unnatural position while i was waiting for a ride to the hospital. I'm super nervous for the surgery and just would love to read some stories, good or bad of some breaks or fractures so I can better pass the time."
"I promise you this is not because it’s Mother’s Day.

For the past couple of days, I’ve been having a conversation with my mother about how I would be a great step-father. Given that most people don’t aspire to be a step-parent, she asked why. I explained that anyone can be a dad, many can be a goof father, but only a few can be a good step-parent. By that, I mean that, in some case, it can be pretty easy for a kid to like you if you’re their parent. They knew you their whole life. It’s somewhat hard to enter a child’s life well after they know you’re not their biological parent. 

Thank you for reading my thoughts and Happy Mother’s Day!"
"Honestly, I don't have a single bad thing to say.

NPC happiness finally gives me an excuse to have multiple bases, and NPCs finally want something for themselves. Also, I've seen players (especially speedrunners) do downright *sadistic* things, and I guess there is no longer an excuse to create NPC prisons...? Especially since I've heard that the Clentaminator can be expensive to use, and lowered prices on solutions would be great for clearing out corruption/crimson.

The zoologist is just AAAAAAAAAAA. I love her to bits. Her ability to summon a cat/dog NPC is awesome. I've always wanted a ""pet"" that's not just a glorified summon. Also, her accessory that allows you to not accidentally harm critters is great because I'm not a sadist. And dog ears? Assuming that she also sells cat ears, I can finally become a catgirl!

Journey mode... Well, there goes two of my mods. One is now obsolete thanks to item duplication. I will still try to obtain some items legitimately, but some items like glass I do not like obtaining legitimately because I worry about renewability. And I can duplicate corruption items so I can still have them even after clearing it out, or boss drops so I don't have to defeat Moon Lord twice. The other mod is obsolete because infection spread is a lifesaver. I can turn it off in Hardmode before having quarantined it, then turn it back on so my Hallow isn't just a weird stripe. (I'm okay with leaving the Hallow intact.)

And I might cheat with Godmode if I find something too annoying or difficult -I cannot tell you how annoying it is to have harpies interrupt my attempts to get a Sky Crate.

I love the new character creation screen, as it will be so much easier and less tedious.

Okay, I'm rambling. I just love the new update. How do you feel about it?"
"What I mean, is that it's probably gonna be awkward after quarantine because we haven't seen our friends and family in a while. I feel people are gonna be less social than before quarantine as this is becoming part of our regular routine and everyday life. Its kinda depressing tbh."

"My work closed March 15 and we have no return date in site. Of course I miss my coworkers, I miss the job itself (for me making something you can enjoy and give immediate feedback on is always a perk),  I miss the money (181$ a week from CA isn’t making me super pumped), but most of all I miss you. Hearing about your day, your weekend plans, your accomplishments, your shortcomings you need to talk over, and the endless list of other conversational pieces. So during this time, can you just chat with your bartender for a bit?"
"Ive started noticing that i enjoy being lonely. I dont mean have 0 conversation with anyone within the day. I am a really social guy but the moment I step in my house all alone i feel you know, apart from safe and relaxed, i feel joy that i am alone with no-one. That i dont have to talk to anyone for any reason from the moment i step foot in the house until the moment I leave again"
"I’ve always loved technology right when I saw a show on TV.  Then video games, the best kind there is that filled up my boredom in some times of my childhood.  I eventually had my own console, the Wii U.  It was a great video game system with many exclusive titles that I loved playing.  As the years went on, I decided to ask for an Xbox one instead.  My parents gave it to me for Christmas.  It was all going well until video games started making me rage. Since today, I’ve probably broken 5 or 6 controllers and 2 headsets.  I’m pretty embarrassed and I regret every single dumb action I have done in the past 5 years.  I’m trying to suppress my rage and to stop breaking expensive stuff.  Hopefully my bad habit changes for the good in the future."
"I know the whole corona situation has caused a lot of negative feelings to pent up in us. But the one thing that keeps hitting me is that the world as a whole is collectively losing a year off it's life. Jobs lost, salaries reduced, higher education plans post-poned, graduations missed. It's like we hit a pause button and it's not restarting at all."
"Actually, this is sort of x-post. I saw the question at /r/nostupidquestions  (thanks to /u/loorrna ) and loved the idea. 

I always begin the day with telling my pets good morning and when I go to bed, I tell each of them a good night and that I love them. Also, I put my wallet and the keys in front of the door so I can't forget them."
"I’m 30 this year. I live with my boyfriend in the house we bought with our 2 dogs and 3 cats. We have 2 cars. And 2 stable careers. I went to college. I graduated from college. 

But I’m also someone who aged out of the foster care system. And I’m not talking oh, a couple months before I turned 18. I’m talking 15 YEARS in foster care. 15 homes, 15 different families. Bouncing around like a dang bouncy ball. I was “that kid” that wore the same clothes and whose mom loves drugs more, and was abused in all the ways, and yet here I am. 

30 and totally normal, middle class. 

Huh. 

Anyone else have any reminiscences during all of this time at home?"
"I’ve seen quite a few posts on Reddit recently about the token “odd” or “weird” or “outcast” kid(s) at their high school and I’m just wondering, how does one know if they’re //that// kid? I hope this doesn’t get taken down (like my last post in this sub) but I don’t mean this to be self-loathing or anything, I’m genuinely wondering. 

I’ve thought now and then about whether I could potentially be the “odd” kid and lack self-awareness about it. I tend to be excluded from a lot of things but I do really try to be nice and polite to everyone so maybe I just am the weird kid. Again, I don’t mean this in an excessively negative way, I was just wondering. I’m about to graduate from high school anyway, so here’s to a fresh start!"
"No that's not what I think actually happened but I'm really curious about what was actually going on. I went to bed at 10 PM to wake up at 5 AM for my shift, but at 2:30 I woke up to pee and this is where it all began. Normally I can pretty comfortably close my eyes in a comfy position and fall asleep within 10 minutes, but when I tried to go back to sleep every single time my eyes fully shut I would hear something super loud and get jolted awake. 

The really weird part was that each time it sounded like a voice, like a booming, old voice directly in my ear. I only remember making out a muffled version of it once, and it sounded like it said ""Rufus."" Which btw isn't my name. It sounds dumb, but after a half hour of this happening, and it happened at least 5 or 6 times, I was incredibly uncomfortable and couldn't actually bring myself to close my eyes and even try to sleep.  I very nearly said F it and got up to play video games before my shift, but I was so insanely exhausted that I couldn't get out of bed. 

I ended up watching Youtube and browsing a bit before I guess I passed out, and my alarm went off. Now I'm at work, where nothing much is happening, and I am SO TIRED. Anyone have any idea why I heard these random voice, or have you gone through something similar?"

I played Minecraf for a few years when it came out and sporadically over the last 6 or 7 years, I never focused on finishing the game, I've always found really fun the part of constructing a home, a farm and mine, just that. But over the last week I've been watching videos of a speedruner called Dream who managed to get the world record of speedrunnig (twice) and that encouraged me to give it a try, so here I am, after 3 days since I created this last world (it's a bunch of time but for my standards it's quite quickly) I stand before the End Portal, really nervous, with full iron armor, iron tools, a bunch of food, blocks and arrows. Will I make it? idk, I hope so. I just wanted to share it with someone and my friends are sleeping so they'll know tomorrow. 

Love u all! Wish me good luck!

(Sorry for my english, not my natal language and haven't practiced it in a long time)

Edit: I made it! I beated the End Dragon, it killed me like 20 times, I almost lossed everything but I persevered and blew that mf. What surprised me was the end credits, I thought it was just a streams of names and what not, oh boy I was wrong. It has a conversation between two beings, and they say such beautiful and amazing things, I cried like a little baby, God, It made me rememeber poems, storys, novels and aforisms, it was amazing. It made me feel worth, love, important. Such a way to end an amazing game."

"I used to be a boyscout I quit because of mental health reasons completely unrelated to Scouts and in 2019 I quit. But I have some good stories from that time, and I'mma tell them

The Grease Fire- I was on cooking duty for the morning I got up early, had a Dr. Pepper and started the fire. I grabbed the dutch oven and put some sausages and bacon in it, and cooked it. The entire camp woke up to the smell of sausage and bacon. This was in 2017. I strained the grease into a Styrofoam cup. This was a very bad idea. I learned this is about 10 seconds when I looked behind me and saw a fire burning about a 1 foot high. My friend who I'll call John freaked out and threw water on it. Now what do you NOT do with a Grease fire. YOU DONT SPLASH FUCKING WATER ON IT. The fire went an additional foot into the air before I grabbed a fire extinguisher and put it out. I necked John, if you remember necking from back in the day and it's not kissing it's slapping someone hard on the back of the neck. I finished the Mountain Man and fed the entire camp, there was only about 6 people. Lesson: Don't pour water on grease fire and don't pour grease into a styrofoam cup.

Burning rubber down a hill- I went to a summer camp which allowed bikes but not for you to go down big hills, weird right. So I was riding my bike and I was trying to find my camping class to get my camping badge. I found it down a hill I said fuck it, and went down the hill I was going fast I tried to stop it. I heard a sound that made me shit a brick. Click this bike has had issues with brakes for about 3 years but I didn't care I was 13 I was stupid and had crippling depression and thought Filthy Frank was the peak of comedy. I tried a couple of more times I started screaming because I'm going down a hill at mach fucking 6 why wouldnt I fucking scream. I put my feet into the ground and used my poor Walmart shoes as brakes I stopped at the bottom of the hill with my legs all scratched up and bleeding because of rocks. I got yelled at by a camp consular and walked my bike up the hill to my class. Got made fun of rightfully because I was stupid. Lesson: Make sure your breaks fucking work before riding your bike, and remember you ain't invincible.


""Its real blood ye' pricks""- My scout Troop thought it would be fun to do a Haunted Trail for Halloween kinda like a Haunted House except you get ticks and it's cold and you get pathetically scared by teenagers in bandages. I decided to be like a bandaged Killer who would hop out of the woods and scare someone. Grabbed some medical tape and an old shirt. I tore up the old shirt and and wore a long sleeve shirt that had fake blood on it. I tried on the medical tape to see how it would work. I took it off, and took off a part of my lip and started bleeding. I ran to my scout Troop and asked for help they laughed and thought I was kidding and I said I quote, ""THIS IS REAL BLOOD YOU STUPID RETARDED PRICKS"" I was a different person back then, and They thought I was playing thankfully my friend's Mom came outside and patched me up. I miss her. We had fun alot of fun.


I miss those guys"
"Didn't know where I could place this, so sorry if I break any rules

Maybe anyone has some recommendations but I like playing wingspan, dominion and carcassonne

"I remember when there was nothing better than mum giving me $5 to spend on whatever lollies and chocolate I wanted at the store, or getting a new toy for Christmas, and even more recently getting a new $60 game for my ps4 would be like striking gold. I was terrible at saving as a kid and constantly worried about not having any savings like my friends did. I am now 16 and earn around $500 a week just from working at McDonald’s! Crazy how things change as you get older. I guess that seems like a lot until I have to start paying bills lol"
"Despite all the stress and frustration we seem to be under with current events, I feel like I've seen an increase in friendliness and humility as well. I still have to travel for work occasionally (never more than 1-2hrs away), and in towns that encourage it, I always try to find a way to safely support a local business. It's cool to see people doing that, as well as all the businees owners I see expressing their gratitude"
"Honestly staying inside has not been good for my mental health and I feel like I'm going crazy. Really wish I could just go back to my normal life again, as I'm sure most others do. It was nice at the start but now it is just awful."
"Has this pandemic changed everyone else’s view of where they live? Or confirmed what you had begun to believe about your country or the world? I now feel embarrassed to belong to a country that prioritizes money over life. I feel sad for those who believe we’re “Great” and we must stay that way.  If you haven’t guessed I’m an American, and I used to be proud to admit it.  I don’t hate my country or the people in it, I just hate how the people running everything have conned so many human beings into buying the bullshit narrative that they care about ALL of us. We now live in a society where corporations are valued more than individuals and I don’t believe the majority is buying into it anymore. I’m not trying to push any buttons, I just want some other opinions. Anyone else going through the same? Not looking for arguments, only conversation."
"not a native english speaker here. i recently got talking with some american tourists. I also have been seeing hollywood movies and shows for a long time, but i have never quite noticed it there. But in real life, when i was getting into deep convos with them (esp. american girls), i couldn't help but notice there facial expressions and their hand gestures. How the eyebrows simultaneously rise up with their ""amusing"" words, the ""Wondering face"" with ""Ummms"", the confused face, the eye rolls, the disgust face and the hand gestures. now in this covid phase, all the cosmopolitan-buzzfeed,etc. article pages shows GIFs of people's reaction and is reminding me of my time with them americans.

i tried but it feels like i need a lot of energy to do just that ."
"In an attempt to keep it short I'll limit the details as much as possible.

I pride myself on being reliable, considerate, and caring. However, I think I might care too much or think too much about other people. I am able to function in my day to day but I do get really down about letting people down and think a lot about how I word or say things. Part of this I think is because I have lost friendships. So, I think I just constantly have these moral conundrums of always wondering if I'm in the wrong/the problem or are my feelings valid. Seems I can't let things go as easily as other people do.

How do you guys balance being a good friend and not caring ""too much"" about them?"
"Does anyone else notice the parallels between the Persian community from season two episode 23 when cheng gets shot by the paintball mini gun in the back of the ice cream truck it resembles the introduction of the mini gun man from the purge two,I found it very interesting and he even had a small militia type group too."
"I've tried to stop being so stubborn, but it's like my brain physically wont let me lol. One day as a kid I was feeling particularly stubborn and told my parents I hated pineapple on pizza, even though I loved it. Ever since then, everytime they ordered pizza, I always had to refuse to eat the one with pineapple even though I wanted it. I'm now almost 32, and to this day I only eat pineapple on pizza when I'm alone...its like my brain refuses to allow me to admit what a stubborn idiot I am, not just about the pineapple but about loads of things. That's all lol, just felt like sharing what a dumbass I am haha"
"Happy Mother's Day to all the mommas out there! Your selflessness and compassion make the world an amazing place 🤟🏻

To all you step-mothers out there... does your family recognize this day for you and how do you feel about this day in general from that perspective? 

I became a step mother (no bio children) to three amazing kids 5 years ago and never realized prior to that how much step parents really invest in the lives of their step children and how little they are recognized for it. Not that we need constant kudos, but it's not an easy job! Not only are we helping to raise our partner's children, but are investing time and energy on a constant basis to blend our own families, cooperate with exes/allow our lives to be scheduled according to their needs, etc. Never has my partner said ""Happy Mother's Day"" to me, but his mother and aunt texted me today to say those words and it was really wonderful positive feedback that I didn't realize I needed. 

To all the step moms out there... Happy Mother's Day! You are loved, your commitment to your children is amazing and your investment in your children is something that they will never forget."
"Recently I’ve been asking people if they’re happy and I’ve had some interesting responses. Some say that they are because of what they’ve experienced in life, while others say that they’re still trying to find happiness. 

For myself, I am happy because of the bad things I’ve faced in my life. I think that my happiness come from knowing that I can make it though the bad times and live to see the good ones. 

So now I give you the question, Are you happy?"
"Everyone please tell your funniest memory and don't forget to put the year of that happened!

Can be everything like forgetting the music on while sleeping in the bus etc."
"It's got the mild alarmesque entrance to break squelch on getting you out of Dreamland, it calms you back down to the groovy tune and beat, it is quirky and fun, makes me take the morning a little less seriously, it's been my Alarm for 7 years now, and I've never once changed it and I'm still not tired of it. It's not stressful, being a high anxiety person myself, this one doesn't really set off anything for me! I could keep going.

What songs do you feel this way about, ones that you personally have strange conviction over like I do with this beloved Nintendo internet software shopping song?"
"She was in a Bright Green Ford Focus Titanium with the Sunroof open.

Instead of closing the shade she just held her hand up to block the bright morning sun for 3 miles before we parted ways."
"I work at an essential plant with 600+ people total across all shifts. Upper management put together goody bags with masks and told us we could voluntarily pick them up and use them and have put alot of great measures into place to help keep us safe. We already had a positive Corona case long ago, so I thought people would jump at this (FREE) opportunity to help protect each other with the bags of masks. Turns out, my friend and I were the only two that picked them up.

You can almost feel the snickering when people walk by and it's giving me flashbacks to being picked on in school for being fat, only it's a mask this time. I've had people tell me how idiotic it is because it's ""too late in the game"" and how pointless it is. I'm baffled, slightly embarrassed, but maintaining wearing it at all times while I'm here because I'm trying to do my part. Has anybody else experienced this? I feel alone in this and it sucks.

Thanks for letting me vent.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the support and kind messages. It means so very much! 🙂"
"After 4 seasons I’m emotionally spent in the best way possible. I don’t recall being this invested in a tv show in a long time. 

I didn’t discover the final season wasn’t on Netflix until it just stopped playing. By that point I couldn’t stop and went ahead and bought it on Hulu. I don’t regret it one bit. Well worth the small expense. 

If you haven’t seen it, it’s a great show with many layers and a deceptively poignant commentary on life."
"First 2 weeks of isolation I was in a bit of a panic, but right now everything seems normal and I feel so comfortable. Hard to challenge my comfort zone in these kind of conditions. So I am bit worried that I will struggle to adjust to new/old 'normality', but at the same time excited to do things again. Does anyone else feel the same?"
"I can only seem to remember my dreams if I drink right before bed (not much, maybe a shot), and they almost always involve me dying peacefully. Does anyone know what this means/Is there any biochemical reason that alcohol would affect this? Or is it just coincidental?"
"As of right now I’m living with my parents. I recently got divorced, so my 2 year old and I are living with them while I try and pick my life back up. 

Only issue is my mother is a heavy smoker. I’ve asked politely that she try to compromise with me while I live here, and try to save up to move my child and I out, and it’s like I asked to take her kidney. She gets mad, defensive, and acts like it’s the end of the world. 

I got told yesterday I smelled like a casino. It makes me self conscious. But I don’t know what to do. I know my child smells like it too, and I know her dad gets mad. 

Any suggestions would help!"
"What is your dream? Did it come true? 

I have a dream of becoming soldier but I have this feeling that it won’t happen. I feel like life will find a way to steal it from me. 

Quarantine does not help. I am stuck with my worrisome thoughts."
"You know how hard it is to hold in a cough sitting in a bus? Literally everytime I coughed someone gave a bad look in my general direction. The thing is, I already had COVID-19 and presumably I have an immunity to it right now. The reason I'm coughing is because of my fuckin' pollen allergies. I hate this."
"I’m a senior in high school and finish in just a few days, but I have NO clue what to do after. I’m not sure if I want to take a gap year or go to college right away, not sure what i’d do in college, it’s all a big jumble of different scenarios that I don’t see myself coming to a conclusion on any time soon. Another problem that’s slightly worrying is even if I were to decide on something to do in college (if I go down that route, of course), I’m a huge culprit of the “the grass is greener on the other side” kind of thought process. If I find myself getting interested in one thing, I’ll lose interest and find something else more interesting all within about 3 days. I’m afraid if I dedicate my time to one thing, it’ll just get old and I’ll regret not picking something else. 

This is getting somewhat long so my question to you is, do you have any advice for me?

Edit: I hope this isn’t too much of a personal matter to break the rules"
"It is crazy to even think back to just 50 years ago... just SO different.

I guess there are notions of BCI and AI and man-machine symbiosis. But it all build on what we know already. What will be the new technology, perhaps the inconceivable? Nanotechnology, quantum compution, biotech, AGI and gene editing all seem very much aligned with future thinking. But I am wondering if anyone here as any more ABSTRACT ideas of what the future holds?"
"That’s all. Just wanted to get it off my chest and tell somebody. And I know there are millions of people in the same boat. If you are, I’m praying for you. Whether you want it or not.

Edit: Holy Moly y’all what a response! It will take time to get through the 70+ comments in my inbox. You guys have been so encouraging!!
Thank you to the Redditors who suggested delivery services. I signed up for DoorDash last night and went out today for 8 hours and made almost $150!! It’s not going to replace my husband’s salary of course but it’s a nice start on a little bit of cushion money. 
Y’all are amazing!!!"
"It was so weird, I woke up from a dream... then I woke up from that very dream o.O

Very inception-esque. Fell asleep in real life, but in the dream following, the brain simulates me as though I was still awake; i.e. I though I was still awake, but in reality, was asleep. Felt like a loop when I dreamt about waking up over and over again, sometimes even up to 3 times or more without knowing which time I was actually awake."
"I have sleep paralysis a few times a year and usually when I’ve been having less sleep or feel stressed, both due to school. 

Last time I had sleep paralysis was roughly 7 months ago.. so I feel another one should be coming soon. 

The very first time I had it I was scared shitless. I was dreaming that I was in my bed and an earthquake was happening but I couldn’t move my body. I woke up and I was conscious of being awake but I couldn’t open my eyelids. I eventually slowly moved my hand to my face to force open one of my eyelids to wake up. I was drenched in sweat. I’m not really sure if this counts as sleep paralysis as I could move my fingers and hand. 

Another time was when I was dreaming about lying down on my bed in my room and there was a white spectre in the corner of my room. It floated towards me and had it’s faceless face directly above mine and afterwards I woke up and found I couldn’t move. Again, I moved my hand towards my face again to open my eyelids. 

The next few times I’ve gotten sleep paralysis I either did the same trick by having my eyelids opened by my hand or eventually waking up after a while. 

How do you guys deal with sleep paralysis? 

Do you guys think my ‘sleep paralysis’ really sleep paralysis since I can move my hand and fingers albeit with a lot of effort, or is it something else."
"No judgement please.

Am i the only one feeling this way especially in facebook? If I feel like I am getting less than 200 likes in my picture, I always think about the possibilities why I am getting such number. For example, is it because I post too much, is it because the picture is not that nice, or is it because people are tired to see my face? Help."
"I strategically made the batter and baked it overnight so my mom could wake up to some loaf cake for breakfast and it worked out well, and I didnt wake anyone up. I even left the finishing touches and left the coffee jar next to the warm loaf right as I was finally turning in to bed myself.
I woke up a few hours later, knowing she had already gone for work, and found the cake... wrapped up in plastic, untouched and set aside. Instead I found store-bought sugar cookies that had been opened and eaten. 
I feel rejected, embarassed, and don't know why I even bothered putting in the effort."
"Guys reddit keeps blocking me so did anything interesting happen 6 years ago? 20-6=14

I can't write years. I feel like that's the worst year ever. Honestly can anyone love that year?"
"Like what the title said. There’s a bee buzzing around in our window. 
We have a...well, a gate you could say as well as a layer (similar to the one that you would pull down/up to lessen the heat from the sun in a car) to prevent any bugs coming inside (didn’t work so well) behind our window. 

What I’m saying is, is that the bee is basically inside our apartment and the window is the barrier. 

My younger brother guesses it’s a honeybee (it looks fuzzy). 
There’s definitely a small hole somewhere that the bee could’ve came through and unfortunately the bee cannot find it. 
We honestly don’t know what to do and my younger brother said to just leave it there to die (but the rest of us disagree). 
Our apartment is small enough to have it constantly fly around, and we have a backyard. 
I was thinking about luring it (I’m terrified of bees for the record) outside, in hopes the bee would come. 

Anyone got any suggestions? I really don’t want the bee to just die like this. 

(Right now we’re trying to widen the hole, but still please leave some suggestions! Especially if something like this happens again)


Edit: The bee is gone!!! It found the hole and left on its own. Thank you to those who commented and I’ll keep those suggestions in mind. 
I really hope that doesn’t happen again...."

"...but I was tired of seeing 399 points and wanted one more.  

So I thought I would come in here before my shift started and say that I’m a COVID-19 nurse (actually, I’m a Med-Surg nurse in a large hospital and in order to keep getting a paycheck I agreed to work with COVID patients.  Now I’ve worked on 7 floors in three hospitals)- anything that any of you want to know?

"They’re just so good, the songs are fantastic. The plot is great. The characters are quirky and loving and just awesome. Sven is fucking adorable. Olaf is just so chipper and never a downer.

1: Seriously, for the record, how much do you love tacos?

2: What is the last song that you obsessively listened to on repeat?

3: Describe for me your favorite inanimate object you own and why you love it.

4: Is Benedict Cumberbatch attractive? Explain your answer."

"Do you find beauty in loneliness, frustration, and sadness? 
If you do, mind to share some things or thoughts bout it? Stay safe!

 Well, for me.. I love to stay up till dawn -  at peace drowning in frustration. Its like a high pressure of thoughts bursting into my mind. I love to feel all the burns and pains. A sweet agony. Isnt it? :)"
"Don’t say there will never be a famine. I bet you would have said there would never be a virus deadly enough and contagious enough to shut down the economy but here we are. 

We started buying lots of canned food to prepare for martial law. At the beginning nobody knew what to expect and we wanted to be prepared for anything. I also stocked up on shampoos, conditioners, toothpastes, tampons, lotions, razors, etc. When I say I prepared I really prepared. Every time we do our regular shopping we grab a few emergency cans of food and store them in the basement along with my emergency shampoos and conditioners. 
We’re on the keto diet right now but if shit gets wild we have endless beans, soups, tuna, veggies, oatmeal to eat. It is insane how prepared we are already. I feel like everyone else hasn’t prepared this much and we the ones with our shit together. The thought of possibly being the only ones unaffected by a famine is a bit strange. There’s a tiny bit of guilt too but mostly I feel content knowing we have lots of space in our basement to hoard food and other stuff."
"I was waiting in line. Then this girl in a light colored casual dress parked her shopping cart like 20 ft away, in my direction. She made some motions like she was listening to a song, I assumed them weren't for me, so I didn't respond. I looked at her a few times, not trying to get her attention, but I wasn't going to avoid her either. (I thought in my head ""what if..."") Then the guy at the front of the line finished checking out and put his stuff in her shopping cart, and they left. 

I feel so defeated. I actually thought for a split second that this cute girl was gesturing towards me. I had butterflies. Now she gone. 
 
What am I gonna do with my life? /s /jk but not really"
"So recently I'm figured it out my cycle when I'm facing something hard or facing things that I don't know how to handle it  


For example, the cycle is like this...  


I have to study calculus for college, then  
My response be like ""Hey, calculus is a cool knowledge"", then  
I'm started studying for a while, then  
In my mind it was too complex, then  
I feel I can't handle it, then  
Procrastinate doing something else all day, then  
In the next day I read a few lines about calculus lazily, but then  
Oh I see, it's just that simple to answer this calculus question, then  
Feels like everything easy  


It happen all the time when I'm facing something hard or facing things that I don't know how to handle it, including when I'm programming at work, help my parent something.  


I know everything takes time and efforts patiently, I just can't keep my self calm on stagnant process, huh even when playing games, take a look at my chess playing history [https://imgur.com/a/c5nOkpg](https://imgur.com/a/c5nOkpg), the cycle is the same, this time the conflict is when I lose the game 8 times in a row, I'm feel suck at chess just like me on doing other things, sucks too, I refuse too play chess for a moment and hate it haha, later I learn something chess technique like playing slow and safe, control the center, castling to make the king safe, then I gain my 5 wins in a row, I'm sure it's my learning not just luck, then feels like a grandmaster  😜 even though my chess rating is 800 - 900  😅  


I share this looking for people that experienced this cycle too, I think it's not just me"
"I previously had Killing In The Name - Rage Against The Machine as my favourite protest song but since I found For What It’s Worth I’ve decided that that song just takes the cake. I found it on a [mountain biking video](https://youtu.be/oQDLAoPs-as) that just blew me away. That video is amazing, it’s all one continuous shot of this dude mountain biking against this impossible green back drop, while For What It’s Worth plays. The simplicity of the video matches perfectly with the song.

I cannot get enough of it. The simple guitar chords are soothing and peaceful and the drums and bass are simple and catchy. The lyrics just speak to me, I don’t know why, I particularly love the lyrics about paranoia. I feel like the line about a man with a gun is very fitting today too, the song as a whole is fitting for the 20th century, as simple as the writing is. The mood of the song captures me completely. I can’t imagine what it would’ve been like in the 60’s when that came out, with the Vietnam war going on. The song promoted peace and anti-establishment sentiments in a time when they were really needed.

I just wanted to express this because I really fucking love this song."
"I’m sure there’s some science behind it but I feel like I sound pretty normal when I talk, but anytime I hear myself on recording I have the worst Chicago-Midwest-Whatever you wanna call it accent. Even people who are from the same place as me have commented that it’s pretty strong. It’s not something I’m particularly self-conscious about day-to-day but when I hear myself I sound like the typical “da bears” type. When I was in high school I was in a short film for a class and as if my horrible acting wasn’t enough my pronunciation definitely takes away from the dramatics haha. It’s on YouTube and my roommates often watch it and 5 years later it’s still cringy"
"My buddy has been steady calling me out for a few weeks over this. We will be in a group setting with friends and in a lull of conversation he will ask, “why are you being so quiet?” Like I don’t try to, I’m just not talkative and I like to listen. I don’t even feel awkward being quiet until someone says something like that. Is that common?"
"Thanks to lockdown I can't sleep due to my inner monologue. I am always talking with myself and I can't stop myself. I don't know what to do. I can't even remember last time I got a good sleep.  


Any recommendations?"
I find myself just thinking about how much I don’t know and how much I will never get to know before I die. I accept it but its also frustrating to think about. Anyone else get like this?
"Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior are kind of screwed here now that Disney's attention is focused on growing Disney+. I can see them staying around until ratings and/or cable TV subscriptions go down, but I can't imagine that they'd be on the air for much longer after that. Though this is a good opportunity to put the entire Disney TV archive up for streaming on Disney+."
"Hello people, how are you doing tonight? I hope you're having fun doing whatever you're doing. These past four days have been a bit stressful for me, I was working on something but I just wasn't able to succed; it got me pretty bummed, but I insisted day after day. NOW, fifteen minutes ago I tried once again and I FINALLY MADE IT. It's so good when we finally get something right, isn't it? The feeling you get after achieving something you've tried for so long is easily one of my favourite sensations in this world. I'm quite the gloomy guy at times, I don't believe in luck - at least not as the main factor in the things I do - but I never accept defeat in things I know I can do well. 

Quarantine gets the best of us sometimes, it surely has changed a lot in our lives. I try to not waste all my energy at once, I save it to try again when I'm feeling better. However, I'm trying to not think that I have infinite time to do things just because we're isolated - maybe it's a positive outlook, some sort of foreshadowing hoping things will get back to normal soon. I hate to be stuck in a certain task, so now I feel released. I feel so good now, I just wanted to share a bit of my joy with whoever is reading this. 

Also, what are the things you guy have accomplished lately and what are the things you're still trying to accomplish? Well, whatever it is **KEEP PUSHING ON!!**"

"So usually, my cat will hunt bugs around my apartment. Because of this, I’ve learned that when he starts intensely looking at my walls and ceiling and looks like he’s following something, there’s a bug. And most the time, it was true. As someone with a severe fear of bugs, having a warning before wandering upon them myself is appreciated. 

However, things changed today. Today, my cat was watching the walls. I immediately scan for bugs. There was nothing there, but I shrug it off. But then, he keeps doing this all day. There is NOTHING there. I checked over and over. However, the last bug I saw was a very large centipede that got away, and now every time my cat looks at my wall (which is frequent) I think there’s a centipede and panic just a little. 

Any weird quirks your pet has or just unique stories?"
"Hey guys, this quarantine has caused a very particular situation around the world, everyone is living through it as best as they can. For me it has been really hard. Let me give you a lit context first.

Not so long ago I was knee deep in a depression that had been going since the 8th grade, finally last year I had the opportunity to have a fresh start and finally started getting better. As every illness leaves a mark, it left me with severe loneliness and problems with building relationships. I always felt no one really cared for me, I always had to be the one reaching out to people, I felt I was a second friend to most of my close friends. When I got the chance to start fresh I managed to make new friendships and renew old ones and all those feelings of loneliness went away.

Coming back to the quarantine, many of those friends stopped responding, I always had carry the conversation, everything from before came rushing back and it brought along the depression. Now I feel like I'm not even worth replying too during a quarantine. One of the closest friends that always helped me during breakdowns broke my heart (not romantically) by inviting me and behind my back another friend to a get away for New years. The day before New Years he tells me that he actually had only one spot and he had invited me and the other friend expecting the other friend would cancel, that didn't happen, so I got the boot. You may see why I feel like a second hand friend.

I just want to tell anyone who is going through a rough spot right now that it gets better, after winter always comes spring. Loneliness is a bitch, it makes you doubt everything and everyone, don't let it win. And remember there are people out there that deeply care for you.

P.S English is not my first language so I'm sorry if there's a glaring mistake that I didn't see"
I’m new to Reddit. What’s the purpose behind Reddit? What’s this thing about karma? Umm anyways I don’t know much lol
"In my head I read it really fast and it sounds like a sneeze. I know ‘girlfriend’ and ‘boyfriend’ are single words, so my mind doesn’t squash the syllables together and make them sound sneezy. But ‘bestfriend’ is typically two separate words. Is this a ‘thing’ now, and I’m just behind the times?"
"Botany and agriculture are really cool...I’ve been a chef for a long time and always been interested in growing my own produce and raising my own sources of protein!

I have two San Marzano plants (spliced into four because they were double stemmed and super super hairy), two Better Bush plants (one was gifted to me by the love of my life and it was so good I got another one), one heirloom big Italian I forgot the name of, a Sungold plant, and one called Champman (it’s supposed to be high yield but I saw this one last stumpy and hairy plant and decided to give it a chance). For my tomato nerds they are all indeterminate! 

I also have two Thai Chili plants considering they follow just about the same regimen as tomato plants!

I also have ordered some more San Marzano and Genovese Constoluto seeds!

Much cooler hobby than I’d ever anticipated!"

"I haven't owned or ridden a bike in nearly 20 years. For a long time I would talk about getting one but I always found ways to justify not doing it. Sometimes it was financial but mainly it was because I didn't want to fail at it if I tried again. 

Literally though it's as easy as the old saying goes. Although my thighs and butt are sore, I'm so happy I did it. It made me remember and realize how much I loved bike riding. 

So if anyone has some good bike trail suggestions in NC or MI, please let me know!"

"Hello there CC! How's everyone holding up and what are you doing currently?


I can't remember when it started but for quite a while now I've seen/read people saying Avatar: the last Airbender is a great show despite its a kid show/cartoon. I was feeling bored few hours back so I decided to give it a go and I gotta say, so far so good! 


Have you done something similar as in start a new TV show or book or even listen to some new songs just because you're bored and you've seen people saying good stuff about them? If so, what is it? 


I hope you are have a good day so far. Hope to have a conversation with you guys!"
"Well, I'm at a loss. Its one of those nights.

I'm lying in bed. I'm high and I have to pee, but I won't get up. I'm thinking to myself, my life could be better. 

I admit I do struggle with being grateful. I should count my blessings. For as long as I can remember, I never made a well thought out plan. 

So I'm wondering, what does everyone do to achieve their goals? How did choose your goals? Do you ever have a difficult moment that lead you stray from your goals? What did you do to push through a difficult time?

I'd love to hear other peoples stories because I'm at a loss. I don't know what direction to go. I'd especially love to hear people's stories of choosing their goal and then how they followed through. 

Thanks,
A lonely girl"
"Just found a spider, fucking massive one, randomly as I went to close the window. My skin can't stop crawling, I don't mind some spiders like the teeny tiny ones which are kind of cute. Not this fucker. I liked this house, shame we now have to burn it down."
"Me, my mother and my sister were casually playing Clue. 
Now I know a lot of people know how to play, but let me explain a little for the ones who live in a cave : Clue is a board game where you have to find the murderer of a millionaire in his mansion. You need to find the culprit between 6 characters, and with what weapon and in what room he’s been killed.

I started the game with an amazing deck, with 4 rooms, 1 character and 1 weapon. FYI, there’s 9 rooms in the game, so it’s the most difficult piece of evidence to find. I already had an advantage against my mother, who might I say, is an incredible strategy player. We continued playing and, with incredible luck, put myself (on tour 3 or 4) in a room that I already had with one weapon and one character that NO ONE had in their hand. So I already cleared two of my objectives by knowing who and with what weapon they killed the millionaire with. Now I only needed to find the room in which he was killed in. The game continued shortly but was really tense. When I was finally ready to accuse, my mother accused right before me! 

That’s where I activate my trap card. 

Throughout the game, the places where everyone went were usually places that I already had in my deck, so when they were questioning who, where and with what, I was only showing the rooms and with SO MUCH chance, I managed to never show my weapon card. 

So I won because my mother accused with the wrong weapon. 
Best game of my life, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have that much chance in my life ever again.

What was your best game luck moment you ever had?

For those who really want to know how the game ended, 
Ms. White with the wrench in the living room."

"My wife and i spent about 6 weeks roaming around in a little rental car and eventually switched to hitchhiking for a couple of weeks due to being low on $$, but not wanting to leave that beautiful place.

I swear to you - we never camped or roughed it a single night from that point onwards.  People gave us rides, chatted about life and the world and insisted we stay the night with them.  
One couple even took us to a walking trail then picked us up at the end of the day and brought us home for a shower and roast chicken...some of the kindest people I've met and really refreshing change from the incredibly vitriolic and polarized internet screaming I see every day.  

Since then we try to share that same generosity with travelers in particular and have met, fed and housed people from a few countries.

Tell me more stories of kind people you met to help stave off the overwhelmingly frustrating and depressing nonsense everywhere else."
"Hey reddit! 

I haven't moved somewhere and looked for an apartment/roommate/job in ages. I've had multiple success stories with finding roommates and housing on Craigslist in the past, but what do people use these days to find housing with other people when they move to a new state? I just browsed it, and it looks like nothing but spam now. 

Looking to move to Colorado at some point this year, if location matters. No city set in stone yet."
"I remember coming across a thread somewhere discussing how KFC is basically the Olive Garden version of proper southern fried chicken. I was surprised to learn that even colonel Sanders eventually ended up disliking the chicken produced by his chain. 

For some reason it then came to me that I have literally only eaten at KFC once in my entire life- what I mean by that is having a full meal there. Went to a KFC in Upstate New York when I was around 3 when my grandparents visited from China. As I recalled, we had the classic fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. I especially loved the mashed potatoes. 

I don't think I ever ate at a KFC ever again afterwards. Kinda interesting for me because I have eaten at McDonald's, Burger King's, and Subways many times- all major chain restaurants, yet I haven't eaten much at KFC. 

I probably did go to a KFC once again in China, but this time it was an ice cream cone. However, I'm not sure if my memory is exactly clear on that. 

Just some random late night thoughts"
"For me, it would be going out for drinks and also making more of an effort to get to know people more. I'm generally a pretty introverted sort of person, but the lockdown has really started to make me appreciate the company of other people the longer this goes on.

"I love how no one is ""famous"" or ""an influencer"" on Reddit. It's just people talking and individual posts getting recognition. No post is upvoted because of the person behind it.

"Whenever meeting new people I get labeled as the quiet one. But no, I’m not quiet. If I’m not speaking it’s because I don’t trust the people I’m around. I don’t have casual conversations with people that I don’t like or trust. Anyone relate?"
Haven’t you had a teacher or a doctor that wore a Peanuts themed tie or a Christmas themed tie and just talking to them just seemed the easiest thing in the world? Like the theme of their wardrobe choice just brightened your mood even for just a fraction of a second and then all of a sudden being told you have growths in your breasts isn’t as terrible as you initially imagined.

"I have a black wire bedframe, and one of those plushy white rugs but I don't know if I want to get some of that marbled wallpaper or do something like faux brick.

"Okay so recently there has been this spider in my room that I keep seing every so often on the sink or on my bedroom walls. I didn't want to kill him so I just left him to hang out. I'm really scared of ticks, cockroaches, and bed bugs that knowing that I have a spider in the room actually makes me feel better.

I named him kevin

EDIT:the corners of my room are apparently full of cobwebs. I never noticed them until now. They have the structure of cobwebs but look like dust so I don't know if theyre cobwebs or not.

Also, I'll try try to snap a picture of kevin next time I see him."
"I was talking to one of my very close friends yesterday and in the middle of the conversation she goes “you are so naturally beautiful.” And within seconds I felt an overwhelming wave of emotions.

I’m 27 years old and the only other person to ever say I was beautiful is my mom.. not to mention, I was also in a relationship for many years and he never once said anything like that to me.

I had no idea that I would feel so emotional about it because it’s just a word... but I have not always been the most self confident person and hearing that really made me feel so good about myself for once. 

Complimenting people is such an easy way to turn someone’s day around. 

I just wanted to share because it’s still making me feel good inside and I’d like to hold onto that feeling for as long as I can. :)"
"So I work in a retail type environment, and since I’m from the Midwest, a lot of times when someone leaves, they’ll give a small “thanks, love” as they leave. This honestly brightens up my day. It’s not in a creepy way, although a lot of men generally do it. To me, it’s just kind of nice. I almost wish people would do it more, but I don’t necessarily want to grow used to it if that makes sense. It surprises me a bit and makes me a little happier every time.

Do you have small things that brighten your day like that? Whether it’s things people say or do at work, home, on the street, etc? I’d just like to know what other people’s favorite small gestures are that others may not know they’re doing to make people happy!"
"My rent is not really that high (just increased from $678 to $720 a month). I make 34k a year working at a warehouse. But I have like 10k in credit card debt. I feel like I have no money even though people at work act like I am rich because I make more than them and bring home cooked meals to work for my lunch.

People don’t realize that I don’t have money for extras or for entertainment. I mean I have a little of my stimulus money left over but not much. I was gonna rent a room from someone but every time I contacted someone about a room they wanted someone that could move in right away and my lease doesn’t end for a few more weeks so I am gonna have to renew. 

I would like to get my finances in order so I can buy a cat, as I am very lonely. My family and friends live in different states and I currently live in Atlanta, which I love. I am thinking of going back to school online for an IT degree but not sure if that’s the career I want but I definitely need a job making more money.. way more. 

I need to start getting into flipping as a way to make extra money but not sure what to buy to make a good profit. I joined the sub r/flipping but no useful tips yet. 

How have you improved your finances ?"
"I love watching TV shows and now I’m looking for a new one to fall in love with. Some of my favorites are: Sons of Anarchy, The Sopranos, Peaky Blinders, Stranger Things, The Mayans MC. I’m open to all types of shows. Thank you in advance :)"
"I'm just curious and wondering where and when did you meet your girlfriend or partner and how it was or felt like 

Each year I'm getting closer to 30 (26 now) and I've meeted and dated a lot of girls but every time it doesn't seem to work out"
"so i find stuff like ghost stories, urban legends, cryptid sightings and to a lesser extent alien encounters very entertaining.  i don't exactly believe in these things but i keep an open mind and i like to exist in a state where anything is possible.  the main issue i have with the veracity of these things is how what's considered a genuine encounter changes so much over the decades.  for example, back in the 1900's if you had a real seance, ghosts always left behind 'ectoplasm' as proof.  these days that's not fashionable anymore so no ghost 'experts' are ever seeing ectoplasm.  bigfoot also seems to evolve every ten or twenty years.  alien crafts do the same.  funny how their technology advances at the same pace as our own.

on the other hand, when biologists from england came back with specimens of the platypus from australia, nobody took them seriously at first.  prominent biologists refused to believe it wasn't some kind of rodent with a duck bill glued to it.  it took a long time and a lot of specimens to prove it was a real animal.  if photos and footprints and fur or scales or whatever a mythical animal could produce were presented decade after decade with that kind of consistency, i'd have a much easier time believing this stuff is real.  that's what keeps me from believing.  it's not my disbelief of an individual because i can still believe them without believing in the reality of the phenomena they describe, if that makes sense.  it's not that i'd have to see it with my own two eyes, because i've never seen 99% of the world but still trust it's there.  for me, it's the historical inconsistency that just doesn't add up.

having said that, have any of you ever come across a story that you found especially compelling?  or even an experience that was way out there?  i know i just trashed the paranormal but i really don't mean any disrespect if you're a believer."
"I don't really know how to explain it but after a few days talking to someone new, I usually just get bored of them even if they did nothing wrong. I feel like I always need constant stimulation and action in my life, that's why I constantly need to meet new people. I tried downloading apps like yubo or hoop to meet new people and it worked but there's only two guys that I've actually became friends with or talked to for more that 2 weeks and I still feel like I need to meet more people. I don't really know why I have this constant feeling (maybe it's because of lockdown and quarantine) but if someone has ever experienced this, please let me know :)"
"Hi! I need some advice. My girlfriend has started feeling useless and feeling like she's wasting her time during quarantine. She's studying but she's not working (she quit before quarantine cause her job was making her crazy with a not very good pay).

I've told her some ideas for businesses but she doesn't want to start anything right now, she says she wants a 9-5 stable job. With this quarantine there's not too much people hiring so it's hard plus there's a lot of competition.

I've told her that whatever happens, I'll be there for her. I want to know if there's anything else I can do to make her feel better about herself.

Also, she lives a little bit far from me so I can't even see her during this time."
"This week I took a break from my beloved pourover coffee to try and cut caffeine a bit and switched to my nespresso pods. They make it easier to regulate intake a bit.

What does everyone drink? Coffee, tea or both? What kinds, when and how?"
"&amp;#x200B;

What is your routine?  What do you suggest for me?"
"Okay, so I am SUPER imaginative. I don’t mean I’m creative, I just mean that I get distracted by the brain farts that consistently come out of me. However, when I am listening to music, those figurative clouds become ONE ENTIRE SCENE. Like, I’ll be listening to Taylor Swift, and I come up with an entire scene in Hazbin Hotel. HUH?! You might not know what I mean; let me explain. When I listen to music, I usually come up with a scenario in my head. Usually, one song equals one scenario, but they can sometimes switch between scenarios depending on how I’m feeling. I literally have Spotify playlists that are titled a certain show. It’s weird but super entertaining. Here are a few for your amusement:


• Mean (Taylor Swift): Charlie is at a country bar, gets fed up with Alastor being a psychopath, and, to his either amusement or sorrow, she does karaoke to this song whilst being backed up by other demons.


• Fireflies (Owl City): Scout gets horrible insomnia from his ADHD and has hallucinations while wandering outside the base. It’s only after Medic gets him inside and gives him medication does he fall asleep. Medic leaves the bedroom, but not before setting a jar of fireflies on his bedside table.


• Have You Seen My Sister Evelyn? (Evelyn Evelyn): The Devil from Cuphead grants two twins the ability to get along with each other and sync up, per the mother’s instructions (she’s the one who asks for a favor). However, they only get along when other people are around, including when they are singing this song for a gig. They find ways to gently annoy each other while singing this duet, and then they are heard beating the living snot out of each other in their dressing room once they think their alone. However, King Dice hears them, then collects their souls when they eventually kill each other.


• Talking To The Moon (Bruno Mars): Pitch Black from The Guardians is talking to the moon, which is where his deceased daughter’s soul is. He sings the song while trying to get enough black sand to reach the moon, but the light prohibits him. However, this version would be on a music box, which would fade into the original. Jack and Sandy may be witnesses.


Alright, that’s about it. And hey, if you ever want me to tell you what I see in certain songs, just comment and I’ll listen to ‘em! I hope this is as cool to you as this is to me."

"My auntie had this adorable mini poodle dog, named Gildor, named from a character from lord of the rings.

He was the kindest dog and I loved him growing up, too bad I don't have many memories of him as I was a baby. I remember that I was a bit rough with him because I was young and maybe pet him too hard or hit him, but he never even flinched, as if he knew that I didn't know better because I was a baby. 

Unfortunately he died of old age and my auntie took him out on a mountain and buried him.

So today, about 20 years later, when we were watching this other dog that looked similar to Gildor at the park, I told her ""hey that dog looks like him"". 

And she said, ""nah, Gildor was more respectful and adorable"". Which I thought, how can a dog be respectful?

But then I realised the bonds we form with our pets and the stuff we feel and experience, it's probably really personal to us and really hard to explain to others.

I also asked her ""ever thought of getting another one?""

And she said ""I think he was the one for me, I don't think I could ever replace him or bond with another dog. ""

Which is the sweetest thing! 

So if you have pets right now, give them a little good boy/girl head pat for me and love them as much as you can!"

So now, I’m going to order from a Xidax X-6 with AMD Ryzen 7. I know, I know, I’m getting it built for me.

"The rules are it can't be something so obvious that people know you're from the future, like a massive battle tank, and it also can't be something a civilian can't get their hands on like a Fighter Jet. But it could be anything a rich person could buy including weapons

"By relive, I mean it feels as though you've traveled back and can feel the emotions you felt along with feeling as the person you were. A feeling of nostalgia, in a way, though different. By observe, I mean you can look back with a sense of detachment. Kinda like looking at things through a more objective lense. Difficult concept for me to try to convey. Hope it makes sense. 

To go along with this, do you feel that as one ages, the more ""detached"" they may feel? Would the ability to relive memories lend oneself to being more ""fun"" and ""youthful"" while observing them would be viewed as more ""mature"" and ""wise""?"
"I don't know what to do with my life anymore. That show was fantastic. Everything about it was amazing. And now I don't know how to move on. That show used all the elements of fantasy and executed the story and the world so well.

"The other day was terrible I was on my third strait  60+ hour week. Every job I went to was a mess. I was ready to burn every bridge I had ever crossed.                
  
Anyway, I stopped at a gas station to get get some smokes and an energy drink. While I'm at the counter  a little kid comes strolling in almost to young to be there alone, but it's a small town. He goes strait to the candy and chips whatever.

As this is happening the cashier is telling me about a buy 2 get a dollar off on the energy drinks so I decide to go grab another. During my walk back I see this kid setting his armfuls of treats on the counter telling the lady that he still wants more but he cant carry it all and that the energy drink sitting there isnt his but the rest is and he will be right back. I walk up to pay for my stuff and say ""I'll get his shit too"" so she rings it up. He returns with his soda haul and I say ""hurry up and set that up here I got it"" he does but says he can pay. She rings it up anyway. I pay and walk out as she is explaining to him what just happened. I hear a ""thank you"" as the door closes behind me.

It struck me as odd that I would even think to do that while absolutely angry at life, let alone stay so angry while doing it. I was just curious if anyone has ever done something similar or just caught themselves off guard by doing something totally opposite of how they feel at the time."
"I have this weird obsession with wanting to live in Staten Island, NY, and I have no idea why. I visited my family in Staten Island when I was a teen, and spent a summer there, and loved it. The people, the vibes, everything. It reminds me of where I grew up in Pittsburgh.

I told my cousin, who grew up in Staten Island, that I want to live there when I graduate college, and he said ""Thats the dumbest thing I've ever heard. No one has dreams of living in Staten Island"", which made me laugh. I literally have no idea why I love Staten Island so much...

"To add some context, my favorite calibers are 22LR, 38SP and 9mm (I've got a bad wrist). My favorite guitar amp has got to be the JCM800, which I recently cloned. 

What would you consider your redeeming qualities? What are you good at/what do you enjoy?"
"I was chatting with my aunt bout my other aunt’s post on Mother’s Day which i misread it otherwise.Texted to send my regards and wished her “happy birthday” she replied “your granny has no birthday because it was during the japanese invasion” i was like “oh okay” . 
do you guys had something similar?"
"
This sweet little old lady came into the post office right before me. We'll call her Miss M.   She was trying to pick up her mail since the mailman would not leave it in her box.  Apparently it was stuck on top of a section of PVC pipe and way to flimsy to put anything in. The person behind the counter was a little rude to Miss M about the situation and it was starting to bother me.  As Miss M was on her way out, she commented that she liked my mask and asked if I made it.  I said yes and I'd be willing to make her some if she needed them.  She accepted my offer and mentioned that *her mother* needed one too. I couldn't say no.  I got her information to drop some masks off to her house beginning of the week.  Little does she know that my dad and I are going to build her a new mailbox post and replace it for her as well.     I'm honestly just so excited to get to help her out.  I have a soft spot for elderly folks and I'd do anything for them."
I'm 14 and my mum has never been really physically affectionate with me in years and today I actually hugged and cuddled with her for the first time in a long time. I know it's only small but it was amazing for me
"Whenever I'm exploring and come across a random corpse/skeleton, I think about who that person might have been and the life they had. It sucks they died how they did, just out in an open space for people to walk by. 

I also feel bad for NPCs in zombie games. They lived their own life just to get sick, go insane, and then be killed by the player.

Am I the only one who thinks this way?"
"Idk what else to say, just making small talk. I'm listening to some music right now, believe it or not the MC channels aren't bad. Had a couple mickeys and a bowl and enjoying the afternoon. Hope everyone's well"
"So I received a text from a close friend of mine saying how he wasn't doing good and how he needed somewhere to vent. I won't go into detail but he is dealing with some serious shit right now. So, naturally I offered him support and advise. 

He thanked me for listneing and closed with, and I quote: ""That's the reason y i call u my best friend""

And I just broke down crying. I just haven't felt this appreciated in a long time and it feels really great knowing that you are someones ""best friend"".

Thanks for reading."
"So I have my alarm set for about 8 p.m. to remind me to take my medication daily. I don't usually take naps after work, but today I was really tired and ended up drifting off. Well the medicine alarm went off and I jumped up trying to figure out why it didn't go off at 7 a.m. like usual. I rummage through my clothes looking for scrubs to wear, freaking out because it's going to be busy this morning at work. I was almost all dressed when I noticed my computer said 8 p.m. I just needed someone to know this."
"Anyone here who have also tried this kind of phenomenon? You hear this strange slow speaking (like slowmo) voice in your head.

 If yes, what is this? Lol. 
 its seldom for me tho, like if i just remember such occurrence (such as: ""oh yeah that shit *referring to that voice* and yeah i could hear it subtly) 
I remember when i was still a grader like grade 3 or 4 i was sick at that time and that voice terrifies me. Its annoying and weird.

P.S. i found some discussion on the internet that they have also experienced this kind of phenomenon but thats it, no further elaboration.

Peace out and be safe!"
"I have lots of free time. Not much happens in job (programming), gyms are closed and I got foot injury so I can't run.

And I have an itch, that I cannot describe. I want to write a program, some web page. I want to write and produce a rap song. I want to record some commentary video for YouTube. I want to make a cheese or bake a bread. I never did any of those things before. Also I am extremely tempted to give job resignation on Monday.

In the meantime I am literally unable to force myself to clean my desk, to do some basics around myself that will make my life a little bit better/cleaner. 

Am I the only one? How do get out of this weird limbo? It gets more frustrating every day."
"Obviously this would be geared more towards office, IT workers, etc. but I feel having employees work from home when the quarantine ends would financially help businesses (office space, materials, utilities), the employees (commuting, eating out, etc.) and the  environment (way less commuting, demand for resources, etc.). 

The businesses could then use this money saved to increase employee benefits, bonuses, expand resources etc. 

This is just a thought!"
"I feel that finding someone you click with is a rarity. And then actually becoming really close friends is even more rare. I become friends with sooo many people who I instantly click with, but the friendship never seems to progress to ""close bffs who is that one person you turn to"" level. Maybe it's because as we grow older, there are less chances of making really close friends? All my close friendships are a decade old. I would call all these new friendships merely ""good friends who I occasionally talk to""."
"I love drawing, its my everything in life even tho Im really bad at it. I want to start doing it as a job and be a character designer for movies and videogames bc I love writing stories and drawing really flashy characters for those stories. I even want to write a book some day!   


My question is what should I draw today? I love drawing cute and small things aswell so send me your drawing prompts! Do you draw or do ""artsy things""? tell me about it, Id love to hear your stories about how you started doing them and see your art maybe.  


Lets chat!"
"This week i started at a new company who does powder coating.
I was told it was a large one because they can coat parts up to 6 meters (~20 feet)  
I got a good colleague who shows me everything but i was baffled at how much you need to take care of and how on point your timing must be… 
Maybe one or two redditors do the same and could give me some tips, Horror stories or inside knowledge about this"
"Being stuck inside all day has made me really bored. Anyone want to talk? I like music, dinosaurs and science. I enjoy talking about nearly anything as I enjoy trying to understand the hard questions in life.  I'm an introvert though so there can't be any small talk. Feel free to message and say whatever :)"
"I realized that recently I have been easily stressed out and anxious about things like making the wrong decisions, or taken-advantage of, or being judged by others. These things would occupy my mind and exhaust me, especially that it would affect my stomach physically with bloating and such. When I try to figure out the core of these feelings it comes down to how I want others to see me and respect me. Any little mistake I make would make me feel vulnerable and my thoughts would start punishing me by telling myself things like “you should know better, how can you make such a stupid mistake when you have been dealing with it for that long?”

Here’s a hypothetical case of what I would go through: I would want to write something about an Air Jordan shoe that I saw, and instead of referring to it with the right model name, I would use a different model name instead. When I realize that the name I used was wrong, I would feel very bad and stress over how I could have lost my credibility to others or that they would see me as an ignorant (fake) person pretending to know something I don’t. 

It’s such an annoying feeling and I’ve been trying to control these feelings better, but sometimes it just slips out of my hands and I start getting into that state of mind. I don’t know many people who I can open up to, but I thought if I just talk about it would help. Do you care about how others might look at you and how credible you are to them?"
"i really be out here with the sense of humor of a 10 yr old, laughing every time someone says “p\*nis”

i also enjoy some dark humor or shock humor every once in a while though, because i'm an obnoxious edgy teenager.

idk this is a dumb question but then again im a dumb b\*tch so what do you expect"
"Hey everybody, hope you're all safe and healthy as much as possible at the moment. This is random but I just got some good news and I wanted to share it somewhere! I'm a photographer working in Brooklyn, and I just got the word that one of the first fashion editorials I've ever shot is getting published in a magazine! This is my first publication and I'm very excited to see where it takes me. You can see it digitally and in print in Dreamingless Magazine starting June 1st! I'll be sure to come back and update with a link when the time comes :) What's some good news you've gotten while quarantined? Or is there some sort of accomplishment you've made while home? Feel free to share below, I'd love to see it!"
"About an hour into my road trip I realized I was wearing my seatbelt. I absolutely hate seat belts but my bf makes me wear one every time I get in his truck, so now it’s a reflex. It made me feel kinda warm and fuzzy :)"
"I'm not a super conversational person, but when someone starts to talk to me about music, I can really get involved and deep in the discussion. Got any recommendations? Looking for recommendations? I listen to just about everything."
"I'm a huge motorsport fan, and lately, using Google Earth's path tool, I have been designing some racetracks in different parts of the world. A lot of the time I try to find a big field or an open area, but sometimes when that isn't possible, I use places such as an airport/airfield or a large car park.

As boring as it may sound, I actually kind of enjoy it. It's quite fun to just let my imagination run wild in a way that is quite unique. I try to be as creative as I can be with my designs, although I do occasionally take inspiration from my older designs or pre-existing racetracks."
"Hi! I’m new here and confused as hell. I love the general concept of reddit, but the rules and threads and the formatting can be so confusing! I’ve never felt like such a boomer in my whole life. I constantly feel like I need to tell people “don’t mind me, I’m new here.” I kind of don’t feel like learning all the rules but I also don’t want to leave. So I think I’ll just end up being that annoying old person that types in all caps and doesn’t know how to do anything."
"Rate your day out of 5, let's talk about it!

My day was a 3.5/5. Kinda tired after this week, so didn't get up to a lot. Got into a new video game for the first time in ages and that was nice at least! Probably gonna be off to bed quite soon."
"now that i’m getting older and approaching the end of my teen years, my childhood dog is also growing older, she’s a super healthy dog and still has years ahead of her, however lately i’ve been worrying about so much about the fact that eventually i’m going to lose her, does anyone else understand what i mean? or know how i can stop worrying so much? thanks x"
"Today I watched lady bird and realised how so often I haven’t been living in the moment myself. Just trying to be somewhere or something else in the future. It kinda hit me hard. Its a great movie.I have been quite zoned out my entire life and it’s been hard to live in the present especially as I am turning into an adult because that’s when all my aspirations were supposed to come alive. Im very hesitant and I have started working on it. It is kinda hard and I want to know if there are others who are facing this issue.

PS - Sorry for the bad English."
"I like to hear about other people. Not in a nosy way. I like to listen, ask questions, celebrate or mourn with you, or just sit here in the dark with you. But never judge.

Will you talk with me, tell me a story? Raw, unfiltered, real. About your life, heartbreaks, achievements. Dark secrets and bright adventures. Fantasies, dreams, goals. The unexpected. Your troubles. Causes for excitement. Your current favourite things. Life in your part of the world. Teach me something. What you are passionate about. What makes you happy. What makes you sad. What makes you *you*. Those stories you haven't found anyone to tell. Those stories you think are too mundane to tell.

You are also welcome to ask me to share a story with you.

No strings attached, but if we walk away with something good — maybe a connection with each other — so much the better.

**EDIT: Doing my best to respond to everyone :) Thanks for being so patient with me! I am enjoying hearing your stories.**"
"I’m from NYC, we are known for our slices plus the dollar pizza as well.

I love Italian bakeries and pizza makers they make pizza very nice.

I’m eating papa johns rn (not trying to be disrespectful LOL, only thing in this COVID 19) anyways.

I was wondering if you guys had a specific place or recipe you’ve had AMAZING pizzas from. I’d like to here why everyone likes that certain pizza from any restaurant put their in manhattan and the World!

Where did you have the best pizza in your life ?

Thank you"
"I haven’t felt this great in a really long time! I feel like my whole college experience was one filled with false beliefs. I was on track to graduate in 3 years and messed that up, then I was on track to graduate in 3.5 years and messed that up, then I messed up this semester and have to take one last course this summer to officially graduate. Due to being constantly let down by myself, I’ve slowly lost confidence and faith in myself and my abilities. 

ANYWAY, when I applied I really wanted to get accepted because they were offering 50% off tuition which is a huge scholarship and it would really help my family (both of my parents are nurses and have COVID patients at their work). I never thought about going to graduate school after my undergrad because I didn’t think I had the requirements for it; instead I wanted to work and gain experience, then get my MBA. Also, the MBA program is for the school I’m going to be graduating from in the summer so the only thing they look at to weigh their decision is your transcript. I didn’t feel too good about my academic performance, but I still applied. I prayed a lot, and swore to myself that if I got accepted I would never eat meat again (I’m a Hindu and I know it’s not a big deal but it’s always created significant dissonance for me). A few days after I applied, I had a dream and in it my sister said that I will find out about the MBA on Friday. I took this as a sign because I genuinely believe dreams mean a lot more than we perceive them to be and applicants were never given a date on when they would find out. I just read the acceptance letter minutes ago and the water works came rolling :’)

For the first time in a long time, I can say that I am proud of myself and feel it too. I’m really excited to get my MBA and work towards making the most out of it. I’m ecstatic and can’t wait to tell my dad when he gets home! 

Thanks for reading and I really hope all of you achieve whatever it is you’re pursuing :)"
"When I started to know about the events going down in China I was actually midway in my 4th semester, Spring '20 of college. We were just done with our OHT# 1 (One Hour Tests) that our department takes every 5 weeks. I made friends with a new group of people on the day of my last test which also had a girl I had began to take interest in. 

I was really excited to join that group, as I wanted to get closer to her and what not. We even hung out on that second last weekend before the holidays came to support a friend who was taking part in a poetry competition, and then went for bowling afterwards.

Then this mess came....at first I didn't think much about it and so I didn't pack much before going home. Thought this would be a 3 week hustle MAX. 

Coming back home after a week online classes started which were a huge drag. I couldn't get a single word what my instructor tried to convey to us. I always either simultaneously listened to music or watched a TV series, keeping tabs on the class so as to not miss my attendance.

Then the Lockdown stretched on and it was aired that all educational institutions would be closed till July 15th.

 Bummer.

I had alot planned for the summer of 2020. I had 2 internships planned, one of which was even paid. I was to practice the guitar and get better at it which I had left in my dorm room since I packed light. I was to have gotten closer to this girl I liked by now, had this lockdown never came.

But being stuck at home and without what I could have had I started to think about doing different things. I thought to expand on my Creative writing which I hadn't poked at for several years. 3rd week into lockdown I started to write songs on my notepad app. I also started to write a sci-fi, adventure novel as well in a rough journal. As of yet the first part of 6 is complete and only needs to be written in neat.

I have also thought about learning how to produce electronic music through software like FL Studio 20 and then hopefully have a fully published song by the end of this quarantine.

Maybe I'm fooling myself into believing that all this will put my mind off what could have been only if, but HEY I think it's working.

Sooooo yeah that's about it, I would love to hear what you were doing and were to do during this time in another reality had this not happened."
"With no soundtrack I mean no artificial music. 

What I mean with artificial music is music to accompany a scene, not music that belong to the scene (a gramophone being played or a scene at a theater)

Some good examples I know:

* The Public Enemy (US, 1931)
* Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (France, 2019)"
Due to the quarentine I went from walking frequently every day to leaving my place once a week. I've noticed that when I walk now I get a VERY uncomfortably chafing like sensation that I never had before. Anyone else get this? I wonder how to relieve it.
"The Pentagon Videos showed flying saucers.

Forget aliens and stuff. Maybe they were human tech. 

But isn't that amazing? A brand new way of flight?

How do you think they fly?

"Not at the same time exactly obviously. But I would consider reading a self development book while I'm in the middle of a novel for example or vice versa. I think it isn't even really that far off reading an article in the morning when you've got a book you're halfway through.

Is there anyone else who does this? Or are you strict with yourself and you wait till you finish the book you're on and then move on?"
"My fiancé and I finally got our first cat together- I’m beyond happy. 

She’s familiarized herself with the apartment, litter box and food set up. We got her loads of stuff she’s ignoring and currently asleep next to me. 

Life isn’t too bad right now and I’m thankful."
"I think that major phone and car production companies should stop releasing a new product ever year. Honestly the only time there are real changes made to the product is every few years anyways. So why not release them like consoles. Or even alternate on companies that are releasing their product every year. 

Maybe one year have apple release a phone and Tesla, ford and chevy release a new model of cars. Then the year after its their competitors. I feel as though the majority of the population will keep that same product they have for a few years before upgrading anyways so whats the point in making a new product every year. I personally would like to wait a few years before buying my next phone knowing that the upgrade are going to be substantial.

What do you people think? Should companies continue releasing products annually? Or should we see a new product every few years with substantial upgrades?

"Despite social distancing taking a toll on people’s social life and putting people out of work, it has actually helped me out quite a bit. I started my first year of college and my school is 6 hours away from home. My first year was pretty rough, I had a few major issues that impacted my mental health and my social life. School in general was okay, I did the work and studied often, but it all still felt overwhelming and too much to balance. I felt very alone. With COVID I was sent home from my dorm to follow the schools protocol and I continued the semester home online. Completing the semester online is exactly what I needed, it gave me a breather and a feeling of relief. I ended with all A’s! My cousin and I have gotten closer and I play video games with him and his friends as well and I talk to them on discord almost everyday since we all have nothing to do. I also was finally able to convince my mother (who was not a dog lover) to allow me to have a dog so I can have a companion with me when I go back to school. So now I have a little puppy named lux and I love her so much (my mom loves her lots too!). Life is feeling better, I feel like I belong and I am worth something. This is what “it’ll pass” feels like."
Hello everyone. My friend invited me to go camping next week. I have never gone camping before. Our trip will involve a short 2 mile hike so I am going to go shopping for some hiking boots. Other than that the only other thing I can think to buy is some granola bars and such snacks. My friend is going to provide the tents and other such gear. Is there anything else I should consider as a firs time camper?
"My grandparents are downsizing, so they have been sending a lot of various things to the grandchildren. Today I got this very rusty, old metal box the size of a shoe box with a little latch. Honestly, it looked kind of sketchy and I was scared to open it. But when I did, it sprung open because it was completely stuffed with papers. It's full of clipped recipes, newspaper pages, and unsent letters written by my great and great-great grandmothers, all from the Great Depression.

I've been laid off due to COVID and having trouble finding another job. My wedding has been cancelled. I had a job offer rescinded and a move across the country cancelled. It's been lonely. And it's been hard to talk to someone about.

But these letters, it's like they get me. Seeing the scribbled handwriting of generations before me, talking about the stress of the economy and unemployment and the struggles of trying to maintain a positive household and spirit, it's so comforting because if they made it, I can make it, too.

I called my grandparents to let them know I got the package. She said they sent it out months ago and it must have gotten lost in the mail, but I think it's more than just a coincidence. I was feeling a little extra sad today and I feel like my great grandmas knew exactly what I needed and they put it right on my doorstep ♥️"
"Nothing too extravagant such as billionaire with 50 houses but if something actually grounded and realistic, what would your own ‘perfect’ life look like? Would you still be doing the same job/hobbies? What about relationships? Places in which you see yourself living?

For me it’d look something like being in tip top shape (physically but more importantly mentally too as we all have our bad days) tanning up on a long 2 month stay in Italy. I’ve been learning the language for a little over two months now, have really invested time and effort especially with the quarantine so I’d be nice to be able to put it to use when I can progress to a good enough level.

Also starting to do my own instructional PT videos, having a solid client base and being able to quit my part time job. All in all, while living in my own space for the first time ever!

What about you? What’s your ideal-but-realistic-but-still-perfect life look like?"
"So two days ago when I was chilling on my bed, a bug flew in from the window. I didn’t care that much, just assumed it may be a mosquito or something. 

But yesterday, man, I found out that’s a HUGE ASS bug. I don’t know what it is, it has a long body and long, thin legs. When it’s resting on the wall it spreads out and is just disgusting. 

I kinda try to ignore it, since it’s not hurting me when it’s resting on the wall. But every once in a while it comes flying into my FACE and no. I cannot live with that. 

18:00 I opened the door and sprayed some hand sanitizer on it to signal it to leave. Wouldn’t budge. 

21:00 Went out and got back. The bug is nowhere to be seen. Okay cool. Went to make dinner. 

22:45 Right after I finish my dinner, I found that it has been right behind me on the wall this whole time. Oh god those long legs give me shivers. 

00:00 Sat on a chair which I don’t normally sit on just to be as far from it as possible. I was regretting why I didn’t get a bug spray at the supermarket earlier and pondering the possibility of going to sleep tonight. 

01:30 Finally decided I had to do something. Put on my jacket, mask, gloves, and tried to hit it with my umbrella. No use. I almost finished the whole bottle of hand sanitizer and it did nothing but make my bed all wet. At this point I was in tears. I legit BROKE DOWN because I couldn’t rest, I was pacing around the room, I was trying to overcome my fear of it but couldn’t, and just saw no end to this whole situation. 

03:00 Texted boyfriend about it. He just woke up (different time zone) and we normally have a video chat, but I wasn’t in the mood so we texted. 

04:30 I decided to call the bf, as listening to his voice may calm me down a bit. This frigging bug comes flying around me AGAIN! 

05:00 Got my jacket, gloves and mask on again and got a broom to try to kill it. Boyfriend was on the phone the whole time to talk me through it and be there with me. 

05:30 It finally flew to a lower place on the wall, and it took me about 10 minutes to pluck up the courage and smash it with a pizza-box shaped box. 

Phew, so that was it. Since around 23:00 last night until now, after six hours, I can finally go to sleep. At times like this I really envy those who are not afraid of bugs or even those who like them. Also, it’s my first time living alone, so had to deal with this all by myself. Anyway, I really wanna know how y’all deal with bugs, especially those that stay on the high ceilings! I could really use some skills here."
"Normal/stamped mail is currently unavailable due to pandemic restrictions so I'll be sending my letter by Standard Mail (with tracking number). My envelope is quite small, C6 size and I'm worried about handling. Has anyone tried this? Is it going to arrive safe and sound to its destination?

I apologize if it sounds like a dumb question. I have never sent anything overseas before. This is for a very special penpal and I'm hoping this will land safely in his hands."

"So in Middle School the students used to sell different assorted candies, and my favorite was a big round lollipop that was sour, and when you got to the inside it would start fizzing from a powder placed on the inside. Does anyone know what these are called? I can't find them! 

I'm having a candy rush so I ordered some Hi Chews, Sugar Daddies, stuff that I loved as a kid. What were some of your faves?"
"I (early 20s,M) have a friend (early 20s, M) and we hang out sometimes and he has a strong scent (not a bad one). We are both straight males. Sometimes before we part we give each other a hug. I always shower every time Ive been out.

I notice lately that I can smell his scent sometimes when he isnt around. For example, I saw him yesterday, I went home, showered, and the next day I was walking then would all of a sudden smell his scent when he isnt even there. It isnt a constant smell, it will come and go perhaps maybe twice a day. usually the day after. I'm not wearing the same clothes as when I was out with him. Is there anything that can explain this? I dont even know if this is the right sub to ask to

Thanks in advance"
"Don't get me wrong I love the old legendary shows like Black Adder, Fawlty Towers, Fresh Prince and a lot of other well known comedies we all know and love. The main reason why I hate laugh tracks so much in shows in the fact that I shouldn't be told when to laugh at a joke or slapstick, that is for the viewer to figure out and personally I think those shows would be ace if the staged audience was dubbed out of these shows which would be a better experience for me.

I understand that some shows have a real live staged audience to laugh at, but in my opnion I still find it mildly annoying as I feel that kind of laughter belongs at your local comedy club in a social gathering, not on TV."
"Just wanted to ask that how long the lockdown is gonna continue in the world due to Corona Virus Pandemic? I am getting curious day by day as my college is off from a long time and now I am worried about losing all the semester education that I had learned in past months before Corona Virus lockdown started. Do any of you have any idea about when the lockdown will finally get over and things become normal like they use to before? I am just getting worried every day. Recently, my university announced summer vacations which are going to last till June. Will this pandemic get naturalised till that month? or will it still continue around?"

"A year ago (it goes even further back, but rock bottom was last year) I was lost with a spinning compass. I've since moved far from home, found work I enjoy, and can take breaths that make me feel like I'm alive again. I'll be in my late 20s[M] this year, and feel like I'm finally moving in the right direction. Still plenty of challenges ahead, but I'm starting to feel accustomed to it (at least the challenges that are managable). 

I was in such a low place a year ago. I wish I could've bottled those moments because they make me feel so grateful for where I'm at today. Sometimes I don't even need anything to feel good, I just need to remember how bad things once were. Though it's not all sunshine and cheer these days; there are still bad days, but I've learned that walking forward is the one and only thing to do. 

The times of struggle have made me a better person, and I'll continue that journey.

If you've bounced up from rock-bottom, what were some lessons that you learned?  Does hitting rock-bottom the second time hurt as much as hitting it did the first time? (I guess YMMV.)"
"I don’t sleep well, at all. I’m constantly tossing and turning, up and down, pacing. 

I pace, she paces.

I toss and turn, she gets up and checks on me. Every. Single. Time.

On top of that I get up early, which doesn’t bother me, but that means Penelope has to get up early too. 

So I’m forcing myself to stay in bed until she decides to get up. I’m happy she’s finally getting some sleep.

"Whenever I smell something nice I remember how often I forget smells even exist. I never wore perfume but I enjoy when someone does. I'm talking about regularly wearing a perfume, and then you associate that smell with that same person. It's a small but very memorable thing.

I was thinking of trying something like that. How to find a nice perfume for myself? I'm a 27yr old male."
"I was so nervous, it was for an engineering position. After nailing the phone interview, I was requested to arrive at the facility at 12 for an in-person interview.

Only problem was, they didnt specify AM or PM.

For me, I didnt know the standard procedures for interviews such as what time they usually occured. So on the day of, I dressed up, drove there at night and waited 15 minutes prepared for a potential interview, just to be safe.

Turns out, as expected, the interview was NOT at night time. I did not do very well on the interview come morning time. I did not get hired.

Looking back though, it was so ridiculous I cant help but laugh every time I remember it."
"I’ve been having a really shitty month, and I was feeling down lately. But today I was in Discord with a couple of friends and randoms chatting and this girl was texting in the chat and told us she’s deaf, fast forward an hour later she joins the voice thingy with us and ends up telling me I have good vibrations in my voice and it’s the best she ever heard and oh my god I seriously can’t stop smiling till now, I’m pretty sure this is the best complement I’ve ever heard in my life and I just had to share it somewhere.


Edit: So a lot of people messaged me and wanted to hear my voice for some reason ahah even though I’m pretty sure it’s nothing special but here you go

"This is a somewhat silly achievement but Tom Holland had posted a story of thischallenge where you have to put on a t shirt while doing a handstand.

I had tried it then (maybe a month or two ago?) but couldn't even lift my hand off the ground. 

But I finally did it this week and am so pleased that I now do it every time I want to change shirts!!"

"I’m not entirely sure that I believe in aliens, but what are the odds that they don’t exist? With all of the “hints” and other evidence that people have found over the years point to things that really seem like we have met aliens already in the past. There are a lot of things that we have found out about aliens through past civilizations and ancient depiction and text of flying objects and aliens. The thing is, would people long ago in their own languages have used the word rocket ship? Rocket booster? Booster? Probably not, but they did use the word chariot. For example when people wrote about flying chariots with wings of fire the chariot could be the rocket and the wings of fire could have been talking about some kind of rocket. However this still could all be speculation. None of this information has been actually proved. If anyone else has any other information on the topic I would love to hear it. Regardless of whether it’s true, false, total speculation. I want to hear it all."
"Like most, I have a lot more time on my hands with this lockdown happening. I’ve started actually watching music videos again, rather than only listening to the song. 
I forgot how much fun they can be, and how a good video compliments the music and adds a layer to the story. If anyone has any recommendations, let me know!"
"Trail mix is the most amazing snack ever. It is my favorite thing to eat and I want to eat it everyday. Raisins, peanuts , and chocolate are the best flavors ever together and I am so happy trail mix exists lmao"
"Whenever I feel sad or angry, I am inclined to make a collage to let my feelings out. But then I would be monumentalizing those moments and leave a tangible object behind for me to remember again. Maybe I should fight the urge and not make them, because who wants to remember bad memories? Maybe I should burn or delete them after. What do you think? Am I right thinking like this? Or is it a good emotional outlet?"
"With nothing but the meme and wholesome background, and publicity from social media, how far do you think a ""Wholesome Icon"" would go in the presidential race?"
" Hey! My name is Ghaada, and I'm 17. This is kind of new to me. Shocking, I've been on the internet for most of my life, but never stumbled upon Reddit lmao. So let me tell you about me... I'm Palestinian, but I live in LA. It's currently Ramadan and man its really hard fasting here. COVID-19 is making me go insane.... I like singing, can't do that while I'm fasting though... thats about it. im pretty boring lmao.

Tell me something about you!"
"Next year I'm gonna have to choose my path and choose a university. But honestly I have no clue what boat to get on.

How did you find out what to do with your lives? I am really confused and scared."
"I’m finally done with the stress and the workload! I really haven’t been able to enjoy anything bc of the stress but I’m done now and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest!

I’ve been writing ideas on stuff to do at home now that I have free time including growing plants, various art projects, a huge list of movies to watch, books to read, and videogames to play.

What are some at-home activities you guys have done?"
"I have been struggling to keep a sourdough starter alive, but I managed to get one going, and I found this lovely 1.5 L jar excellent for holding it. Today, on a whim, I decided to make sourdough pizza, so I checked out a couple YouTube videos, and came across [this video](https://youtu.be/l3GcHQoxrYA) from a YouTube channel I recommend, so I decided to just go with it, adjusting the recipe s bit to what I like, and I just feel free to make these types of long ferment type of recipes due to the extra time I have due to quarantine.

But this got me thinking. ""am I the only one taking the extra time to cook?"" And now I wanna ask you guys what you're up to, as far as cooking goes! Have you guys  been trying new recipes, taking more risks, or generally having more fun in the kitchen?"
"She lovedddd the movie I suggested. I suggested Amelie. 

We have been talking non-stop since 15-20 days, but we have known each other for 2 years. 

I'm glad she called because I'm an introverted person and would never make the first move. I like the girl. She's smart and funny and we have been vibing during this quarantine. 

Am gushing rn."
" I ain't sure if people actually would enjoy reading something like this, but since this is a unusual subreddit, where people are way more cool, and chill, than in other subreddits.

Since i downloaded Reddit, in september, last year, IIRC, i started to see my usage of words get better and better.

 Before, if i would try to arguement with someone about something, i would normally fail to express myself, and usually get people confused about my opinion. Now, i express myself better, take lesser time to write more and sometimes even convince people they are (partially) wrong.

 I am sure i ain't the only one who ""have been through this"". I love discussing, peacefully, and being able to comunicate better with people on the internet, on a different country, is just great.

 I never had an english course, and being able to watch a movie without subtitles, and actualy understanding it, is awesome."
"Woke up on a Saturday at 8am just like any other weekday to realize the day and ponder I don't have to work today, so what the hell do I do?

Weekends feel same as weekdays except the work... Bored of binging tv, cooking food, chatting with the same friends. 
What's up reddit?"
"This morning I went about my typical routine of waking up early and taking my dogs to the dog park. When I got their I saw a baby husky puppy and it was the cutest thing ever. 

I asked the man where he got her and his response was ""the state paid for this puppy"" and he laughed a little. I asked him what he ment and he got such a big smile on his face and told me he had recently just hit it big in the lottery and he's buying a couple things that he's always wanted.

I asked him if he's comfortable telling me how much he won and he was more than happy to tell me lol. He said he won $250,000 dollars and after tax his take home was around $175,000. How nice is that!! 

The dude was on top of the world. He pointed to the parking lot to show me he bought his first ever truck and it was super nice. He said so far he's just bought the puppy, the truck, and paid off some debt. Truthfully, I'm happy for the dude. If you don't play you'll never know if you'll win."
"This last half of my last semester was really rough on me. I was trying to apply for graduate school; finish my bachelor's degrees (double majored in Psychology and Religious Studies); help my grandmother who had a stroke last year; and my mother has been on the brink of a panic attach almost every day due to a combination of work, her PhD program, and helping my grandmother. I got really depressed with the quarantine and stopped participating in my classes since that all moved to online format, but I emailed my professors earlier this week to try to make amends. They told me I could turn in a few things to pass, so I've rushed to get them done and now I'm going to graduate with TWO DEGREES! I'm so excited and I'm honestly pretty proud of myself for pushing my way through all the shit I've had to deal with in these past few years."
"For instance, after giving it a thought for about a minute or two, I cut my own hair. I've gone bald. Received a lot of criticism, laughter and bald jokes for it hence I'm looking forward to such things. Anything that I can do while staying at home or something which y'all have done to kill your boredom is appreciated. Thank you"
"I've been in quarantine for 2 months now but luckily I'm able to work from home.  It's made me thankful and it also inspires me to work faster.  With more work getting done, I have more free time.  I've decided to use that free time to get back to exercising regularly.  I've made a whole new routine.  I wake up at 9:00 and then work until 4:00.  After that, I start doing my exercises for an hour.

I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I feel much more confident than I used to be.  It feels awesome.  I hope that anybody who reads this is doing good too."
"I've previously been that person who drinks fruity ciders and lemonade with wine because I don't actually like the taste of alcohol, but the thing is I don't think I like any part of it at all. I've been drunk three times and I didn't enjoy it much, I certainly hated the week long hangovers. I just keep drinking these things at events or with my parents or friends because it feels less awkward to say okay when I don't feel strongly about it either way. My family are all seasoned drinkers, not alcoholics but they consider a few drinks a day casual and rarely get drunk because they're used to it. I just don't feel the same way, and I'm going to start saying no because I don't think I get anything out of it. Anyone else feel like this?"
"I've just been feeling shitty and depressed for weeks. I just recently realized it's because of some of the subreddits I follow is making me feel this way. I followed things like r/trashy and r/entitledpeople since I thought it's entertaining and funny how some people are idiots. But then it comes to a point where I see so much of it and it reminds me that the world is a shitty place. Also that so much idiocy doesn't seem funny anymore, it gets depressing. I already know that these kinds of people exist. I don't need to be reminded about it everyday.

So I just went through my list and unfollowed a bunch of subreddits that are like that. There's still news related subreddits I follow like r/hongkong that I follow so I can stay informed. That also gets depressing, but it's different. I look through that subreddit and feel hopeful that things would get better. In the subreddits like trashy and entitled I just think, ""these people are hopeless"" and lose faith in humanity. I care about the wellbeing of Hong Kongers, not Covid-19 protesters that want everything to open up again. 

Anyway, I feel like I'm already feeling better. Most of the subreddits I follow are animal related. Mostly cats. I would feel better waking up the next morning and the first thing I see is a cat sitting on a pizza box.

How many of you have done this? What sort of ""feel good"" subreddits do you like?"
"I have been looking for a new phone lately and I have realised how I still could not buy a phone without a 3.5mm connector. There are many phones that I wouldn't mind buying because of their quality but they lack that one thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I love using Bluetooth headphones while on the go because of how easy it is to not mess around with cords the whole time in public. But I can't be the only one who plays music in their old car that doesn't have Bluetooth through their phones. Nor does my speaker system in my room have Bluetooth capability because of its age. 

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, I would be buying myself a new flagship iPhone or a new galaxy but they lack what I require a lot in my daily life. Instead of buying a new car, upgrading the music system in it or buying new equipment for my speaker system, I'd rather buy a Xiaomi note 10 which probably won't last with me for as long as an iPhone would. Please tell me your opinions, suggestions and your own troubles consisting of the topic. I'd be glad to hear them."
"(Flair??) 
In my first apartment, I found a long, thick, strip of skin, like a callus that had been cut off. That was gross on its own, but it had also been tied in a knot. The management didn’t believe me."
"To be clear, I’m not really even close to owning a home with a really nice kitchen. I’ve just finished my 3rd year in college and I’m currently living in an apartment with a small kitchen. It’s capable, but not incredible. This covid quarantine has exacerbated my already present love for cooking. I’ve loved cooking ever since I was little, and now I feel I’m very competent in the kitchen, but I feel limited by my tools (it’s more than that, I just can’t think of the right word at the moment). I watch videos on YouTube by the likes of “Binging with Babish” and “Sorted food”  etc. and I am just so jealous of the kitchens all of them have. I really can’t wait to own a house with a really nice kitchen, and I would consider that a top priority when house shopping and I hope I have the opportunity to own a house with a REALLY nice kitchen."
"There’s is this one guy I know and personally I couldn’t stand him up until I realized something today. He’s always the kinda guy that tries to one-up everyone, talks crap, tries to assert his dominance, claims to talk to the most girls, etc.  He would sometimes say things to me in front of our friend group trying to one-up me the rn just being rude in general. I’d let it get to me, though I’d never show it. But today, I realized that odds are he’s probably just really desperate for acceptance and is insecure himself.  Since we have very different personalities, he might see me as an easier person to try and feel leverage over, but who knows. 

But I’m just glad I finally realized that there’s nothing wrong with what I’m doing to make him say those things and suddenly all that bubbled up resentment I felt towards him is gone.  I hope I can continue to understand people from that sort of perspective as I continue to grow as a young adult."
"My ex-husband left me to do everything. Work, clean, yard, groceries, etc. I left 4 months after having “our” child. “Our” used loosely cause he hasn’t seen him since my boy was a year and he’s 23 now. I did it all for years. 


Anyhoo.... my boy can cook, clean, preserve food by canning, freezing, dehydrating, he can hunt, he can raise rabbits and chickens, breed them and butcher them humanely plus cook them. He can also work some on cars and do minor repair work, plus use woodworking tools to build and repair things. I was absolute with him knowing how to take care of himself and NOT being like his worthless father. He and I had our differences but after him taking a few years to sort himself out... he thanked me for teaching him so much. We learned a lot together through 4-H and life. I’m proud to know that he now has a wonderful girlfriend that he takes care of. They both work and have taken the time to figure out what they like to do or not do, and divide the chores. When he tells me he rubs her feet every night (for the last 2 years) she nods and laughs. 

Finally being a single mom has paid off!"
Yo the rain in Korea is MAD REFRESHING! Have you ever felt it? It’s like one of those Budweiser moments drinking a Budweiser with your shirt off. You think they have those here in the United States of AMERICA? Those rainy days are making me feel like a new man yo. Teaches discipline! Think you ever had a day like that?
"I've had a rough go of since I moved out on my own...about 8 years. I've battled alcohol and substance addiction, gone through so much in my life...didn't care about anything or anyone but myself, but I've finally put that behind me and reached a new milestone. I've successfully saved and out away my first $1000 toward my emergency fund. It's not much but I'm extremely proud of myself for finally changing..for finally finding enough purpose in my life to be motivated to do this. It feels SO good. I've came a long way you guys. My family doesn't really care, but I do. Just wanted to share something positive."
"I’ve been stuck at home for over 7 weeks and I’ve lost all motivation to get my homework done. The only person outside of my family that I have talked to is my best friend. I don’t even have the motivation to play video games with my brother. Which I love doing because we both have a great time. I just realized that I haven’t done my math in over four weeks and I cried a little. And now I’m sitting under my desk.

I think I need someone new to talk to and help me get through this. Is there anything that can help get me motivated?

Sorry if this doesn’t go here."
"For 2 years, I stayed quiet about my depression. I knew something was wrong with me, but I was too scared to get it confirmed because then it would become a reality, meaning I could no longer pretend it didn't exist.

2 years later, I finally plucked up the courage to get help. Just as I suspected, I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I started behavioural therapy, and clinics quickly became a second home to me. 

Last month, I stopped going to therapy and stopped taking my medication. I could feel myself getting better. It was the first step towards a new beginning. 

Today as I sat working at my desk, an indescribable feeling washed over me. I didn't quite understand what it was. It felt new and unfamiliar. However, I soon experienced a sudden realization that prompted me to burst into tears. 

I felt happy. So incredibly happy."
"I'm a very positive but sarcastic person.

I woke up today and saw a post from a certain someone I'm no longer on good terms with, this dampened my mood by a large amount.

I promptly removed this person so it doesn't happen again but here we are, I'd rather not have their effect on me last all day.

Any help or suggestions are appreciated :)"
"I miss just having long-winded conversations with people, so I’m here to just ask, whats something you love to talk about? Would love to learn what you’re into and have you just talk my ear off about it."
"If you were granted the option to buy anything at any cost, but it is the last thing you could every buy or spend money on (i.e. a concert) what would it be? Disregarding the basic necessities shelter, food, water.

Im curious to see given that we are in a pandemic what people would spend their last on"
"There are some people I that I now in hindsight understand how poorly I treated.  They’re good people who showed me so much kindness when I was going through a difficult period and I didn’t care about other people or their feelings.  This really wouldn’t be an attempt to rekindle whatever relationship we may have had, I would just like them to know that I’m sorry and that they didn’t deserve to be treated that way.  Another part of me feels this could understandably be received as a way of making myself feel better about me as well as unnecessarily reminding them of unpleasant memories that have been long out of their mind.  No I’m not in a 12 step program, just in a shame spiral.  Does anyone have experience being on either the giving or receiving end of an apology of this nature?  Even if not, what are everyone’s thoughts on this?"
"I live in a temperate state, so we have all four seasons. But I'm also fairly high in the mountains about 1200 feet. Usually may is very warm. Anywhere from 60 degrees Fahrenheit to 80 degrees. I'm just astounded by the fact that it is snowing this late in spring."
"A few years ago I posted about getting into my schools engineering program. Today it just hit me that I've finished all my work and turned in everything and now I'm done, now just to wait for my degree. The only thing I hate is how much graduating classes are missing with everything going on. Our engineering class probably won't get our photo in the engineering office, what's something that you guys are missing out on because of COVID?"
So not talking world hunger or global warming... just little stuff like losing your keys a lot or forgetting to set your alarm. What are some problems that you encounter frequently that you just wish someone would solve? No problem is too small or too out there. Shoot from the hip. And it’s totally okay if you have more than one!
Are dog walkers or similar volunteer positions at animal shelters expected to assist with upsetting situations like being involved in putting an animal down? IE: Hey so and so we need you to jump in
"This might been a reoccurring topic on here, but I’ll just throw it out there.

For some people it might sound corny, but for me it has to be Its A Wonderful Life. I make it a tradition for myself to rewatch it every New Years or Christmas. 

No matter how much I prepare myself for the whole town coming together to help George, it always hits me hard. He worked his whole life, never attaining the things he dreamed of, for the sake of his friends and family. He always felt he had been cheated out of the things he wanted, but it took everyone that cared about him to realize that his life was anything but failure.

I think it always hits hard for me because I never really had something like that happen to me personally. But living through that scene vicariously just shows me that, despite what I think sometimes, there are people that care for me and there are lives out there that were changed for the better because I was there. 

“To my big brother George, the richest man in town.”"
She reads the question out to me and asks “without your phone right?!”   English isn’t her first language and that’s why she isn’t familiar with the phrase. But it made me laugh out loud!
"I have been a Reddit lurker years. A few days back, I tried creating a subreddit for a topic I enjoy. I found out that you need a positive karma for that.

So yesterday, I did something I couldn’t bring myself to do for years: comment on people’s posts. I always find it scary before since you wouldn’t know what people will reply to you. But I wanted to get over that.

To my surprise, it was so fun! I love how you can have discussions with other people about the topic, or sometimes encourage and help other people to pursue their interests more (especially for those posts that have little upvotes or comments).

A couple of learnings:
- I find it hard to participate in large subs due to the number of posts in new. I enjoy smaller and niche subs more.
- Personally created content is so much better than a repost of someone else’s.
- It’s not about upvotes. Be authentic as you are while complying to the rules.
- I enjoyed it better when I treated Reddit as a community rather than the typical social media where you just consume content.
- I love people! It’s so heartwarming for me to know more about the lives and thoughts of others and learn from them.

With all those said, how do you enjoy Reddit? Do you have any tips how I can enjoy it more? Is it better to join a few subs I’m really interested and invested in, rather than follow a ton?

I’m interested on how you do it."
"What is wrong with people?! They’ve stayed home so well and now the floodgates are open?! Wtf? I’m a nurse, and I am not looking forward to work in a week or two."
"This is something I have done since my childhood probably. I like to  draw and create characters and concepts as if I'm creating a videogame or an anime, I'm sure I'm not the only one that do this. As I grew older, my characters are getting more complex and realistic, as I like to study things like character building and narrative tropes. Keep in mind I'm not writing a novel or anything, this is just a hobby I do in my head.

To help me fall asleep, sometimes I like to create scenes from my imaginary movies. I like to imagine them just chatting in a bar or a cafe, it's fun and this helps me exercise my 'script writing' and make them more humane. 

Today as I struggle to fall asleep, I realized that I have been subconsciously projecting myself as one of my characters. I'm having a rough time in my life right now, and I don't have any suitable place to vent or share my stories. So I imagined things that I would want to hear from other people, spoken by my other characters. It didn't help much, but it helps me find silver lining and other perspective in my life.

Anyway, it's Saturday 7.30 in the morning and I haven't got a wink of sleep. I posted this because I feel like I needed to share this with someone. I'm not the only one that's like this right?"
"Long story short, I somehow got a japanese girlfriend and became vegan recently and apparently he doesn't believe me and wants evidence that this is true.

" Yes i know fast food is bad.   But I love nice milk shake or a malt once in a while.

I   can pretty much tolerate a shake from anywhere else except McDonalds.     No need to go into details here lol but it doesn't agree with me.  So  I  am just wondering.   Any other ice cream or shake lovers out there  have  problems with eating/drinking McDonalds shakes?

P.S.   this month  I have also had a malt from Culvers and a shake from Cold Stone with no ill effects."
"Sat on my couch in my parent's living room and sent my email to my advisor, so it's over. I think I'm a more than a bit bummed about how underwhelming it's been thanks to the past few months. College was so important to my family and so much of it lived up to what I wanted it to be, except for the most important moment of it, finishing it. The project was on a subject I cared so deeply about too, but I've had so little motivation to work on it since having to move back home that I was just glad to finish it. 

I'm trying to be more excited about the future; I'm hopefully attending an awesome Master's program but it's international so it's still a question if whether I can go or not. I guess I'm just a bit sad right now, but I hope in time I'll be able to look back and feel a bigger sense of pride in what I've accomplished. 

I know a lot of other college seniors are going through the same thing, so I hope we all find a little bit of happiness during this would-be grad season."
"Now I think everyone’s infected and I’m terrified when the mailman hands me my Amazon order and neither of us were wearing PPE (to be fair, he caught me when me and the dog pulled up to our curb from the park, I couldn’t refuse without looking like the ultimate dick). Straight up, now I have to reset another 14 days? Yup. 

So I’m watching every silly show and fun movies, and I miss the way we all used to just *mingle*. Without even going into how much I miss my family and how hard I’m craving live music, just not being freaked when the mailman brings me something cool is a new development.

I hope we get better protection, treatment, testing, funding, and leadership. And soon. We need some help, ya’ll."
"I've been avoiding going on my balcony for quite some time now, because for some reason wasps really like hanging around there, and I've been quite scared of wasps since I was stung by 4 at the same time when I was little. It really stuck with me and since then I freak out whenever I hear buzzing close to me or when I see a flying insect heading towards me that I can't really identify. I know it's pretty irrationnal but I really can't help it

So instead of going on my balcony, I'm just content with staring outside the window and enjoying the view lol. And plus I can observe the wasps from a safe place, which, even though I'm afraid of them, they're pretty interesting to observe I think. And that led me to see something a bit weird :

I noticed that the wasps that fly around my appartment fly in sort of a weird way in comparison to your typical flying insects : their legs kinda dangle under them, as if they didn't really know what to do with them.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to google ""wasps with legs dangling when flying"" and I found out that these wasps were paper wasps, which, as I found out after researching a bit more, are actually reputed for being pretty chill and only attacking when really threatened, unlike yellow jackets who apparently are more aggressive, and kinda like bees. You can differentiate from yellow jackets because yellow jackets don't fly with their legs hanging.

And that made me feel a bit safer, because now I can look at how the wasp flies and determine if I should go back inside or just calm down and let it do its thing. I mean, I think I'll probably still panick, but it may help me feel less threatened and maybe I can even try to enjoy spending time on my balcony every once in a while...

TL;DR : Found out that the wasps hanging around my house are a less aggressive species of wasps, and it made me feel safer

How about you guys, how are you trying to address your phobias ? Do you have any other wasp facts that could help me rationalize my fear of them ? I'd love to hear how you deal with your phobias because it makes it kinda complicated to enjoy being outside during the summer.

Hope you guys are having a good day btw, and that the lockdown isn't too hard for you."
"I think a lot of us are unhappy with our life because we don’t often make and build things with our hands anymore. We evolved building things with hands outdoor. It sparks creativity, dexterity and reduces stress. But now all I do and see people do is using their fingers scrolling through their phone and typing on the computer."
Any time I eat a kiwi (skin included) I get looks of sheer horror and disgust.  I get the fuzzy texture thing but it doesn't taste bad.  Lots of good stuff in the skin too... kinda like a potato skin... the healthiest part of the potato.  I don't think I know anyone else who just bites right into a kiwi without peeling 🤔
"So I've had this discussion with my friends and family... I just want to know who says ""Paper Rock Scissors"" rather than ""Rock Paper Scissors."" Also, do you know why you say ""Paper Rock Scissors""? 

 I don't know why my sister and I say ""Paper Rock Scissors"" but no one has ever tried correcting us as of recently. Its like no one noticed before or something. I've always known that other people would say ""Rock Paper Scissors"" and I thought it was just preference until people started telling me that I'm saying it wrong lol

Do you guys know of any reasons why it would be one way or the other? I'm just genuinely curious.

"Three weeks ago I finally made the decision to quit eating junk food. After my life consisting of eating chocolate for breakfast, with dinner and tea.

I didn’t necessarily build my self up to do it, I just woke up and thought I’m going to quit because it isn’t good for me. I guess I got them quarantine self improvement vibes.

To be quite honest now that I’ve done it I feel better in myself knowing that I have a good diet (I’m eating lots of granola/fruit). I feel kind of healthy for the first time in years.

I have been having some withdrawal symptoms such as blurred vision and headaches but it’s totally worth it. I haven’t been craving junk food though which is great. It’s been so easy to do (apart from the withdrawal symptoms).

I’ve always been a skinny dude (19m) and I can eat anything without putting much weight on if any. So hopefully with a healthy diet and exercise, I can get myself in good shape.

I’d love to hear your stories if you’ve done anything similar?

All the best,

Rhys :)"
"I've always struggled to describe how I feel, especially when it comes to negative feelings. I found some amazing friends I feel comfortable talking to about anything but it is still hard so often I send them a song and go: This is kinda how I feel rn.

I think it really helps trying to explain what is going on inside of me and also I learn how to put words to my emotions.

Does anyone else do this? Do you have other ways to explain yourself to other people?"
"I just moved into a new apartment that faces an alley so it doesn't have much sun (as in, I need to keep the lights on all day if I want to see colours lmao). It's been doing a number on my mental health recently since I can't exactly go somewhere sunnier, but I moved my desk to the window and realized that I can see tiny birds hopping around on the ground and sometimes a squirrel or two will run up the fire escape! It's very small but it made me happy and I wanted to share"
"For whatever reason, could be masochism (who knows??), I’m doing a dual Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in 4 years. Parts of the last year have been actual hell. There were so many times since my first year that I thought I would have to drop out due to financial reasons. Last semester I experienced some traumatic shit on top of tight finances and I truly could not see myself finishing. Working and writing gave me panic attacks at times because I associated it with the trauma of the end of last semester. 

I wrote and researched the majority of this 76-page beast in the last two months (kinda changed direction from my original plan), wrote through tears, etc. On top of that, it’s in a foreign language. Today I was overtaken by the adrenaline rush of needing to just get it over with. I still have my defense, might go back and edit some more if necessary, and some other final work in the next week but holy fuck!!! I wrote that. It’s not my best work at all, but right now I don’t care."
"My name is Alayna and all of my friends call me some sort of variation such as Lay Lay or 'layna or Laney and I just think its so sweet. I honestly love it and they all have special ones and everything. I mean I only have a few friends but it's honestly so loving and adorable.

I have my own personal nicknames that I call my friends and I just can't. I'm so glad that there are people who can accept me."
"Saw some really pretty purple orchids at the store the other day, and remembering orchids were my moms favorite, I bought them. I had no place to hide them but my shower. She was helping me Reno the bathroom so that was probably a poor hiding place but I had no where else to put it. Today she was sanding some filled nail holes, and went to peak in the shower to look at the shampoo rack or something. 
I freaked and told her to get out of there. She immediately looks further in, now suspicious of my reaction. And sees them. She quickly poked out of the shower. And kinda blamed me for overreacting, saying she wouldn't have seen them had I chilled out.
That really annoyed me cause i think she would've seen them either way. 
Told my dad I blew it, cause he went with me when I got them. She told me I shouldn't have told him, cause it would just bum him out like it did me. 
That just got me more upset.
She apologized later. But this just sucks.

Sum: Tried to do something nice for mothers day, ruined it with my anxious reaction to her getting near its hiding spot."
"Hello Reddit,

I have just completed *To Catch a Spy, The Art of Counterintelligence* by James M Olson. It was a very interesting and informative read, as such I am looking for some recommendations!

I am aware that this book is somewhat niche in its audience, however I figure it is worth asking.  


Thanks in advance."
But I’ve died probably hundreds of times in my dreams. How about you?
"Think about that question while I briefly share..


In mid 2019, I saw this posted up on a billboard while driving to work. Got me thinking of things I’ve never done before. Since then, I’ve created a list of activities that I’d like to try out. Id like to share it with you and encourage you to share with me!!

Play mini gold
Drink a martini—extra dirty!
Travel on a plane
Donate blood
Go camping
Change a car tire
Try a Krispy Kreme donut
Research D&amp;D; begin a campaign
Roller skate
Get a massage by a professional
See a movie at the drive in theater

Activities I’ve accomplished so far:
Horseback ride
Traveled on a boat for my first time
Went on my first vacation!!
Went apple picking"
"So I'm in the middle of watching Naruto Shippuden (season 7) and I don't have any friends who watch the show. We can chat about anything in the show, or characters that we ship. So just stop by and chat about the obsession you have or had."
"I basically only wear Jeans, Shorts, T-Shirts, Polos, Socks and Boxers

Some people have multiple hampers or basket for dirty clothes. My cousin puts his T-shirts in one hamper, his boxers in one hamper, his pants/shorts in a different hamper! He has like 3-4 hampers for different clothing.

I guess I can see putting your socks and boxers/underwear in their own hamper? Is that normal?

Do you do this? Or do you put everything in one hamper/basket? Meaning you put your shirts, pants, socks, underwear, pants, whatever... all into one hamper/laundry basket?

Follow up question: How often do you do your laundry and how full does your basket have to get?"
"I was just told that I spend entire nights screaming and crying in my sleep. I used to live alone, but I moved in with my brothers during the quarantine. And today they randomly mentioned that being woken up by my screams and having to get up to take care of me was slowly becoming a burden to them. And it really scares them because I scream as if I was in a lot of pain and it's so realistic they can never be sure it's a nightmare or if I'm actually in pain. It happens 2 to 3 times a week. I have no recollection of those nightmares, nor of my brothers waking me up and talking to me, but I know they were very serious and wouldn't lie about it.

This is so strange. What could be the reason ? I have occasional insomnia, and suffer of bipolar mood disorder, but everything is under control with my medication and therapy. This extreme behaviour comes as a complete surprise to me."
" In a hypothetical situation, there is a one-year-long project that needs to be completed and the minimum amount of people involved is twenty. Would you rather be the leader, the second-in-command, or remain in the shadows when it comes to a personal or professional long-term project involving no less than twenty people?

Would your answer change if 10 people? If 100? If one month? If a specific project?"
"I just accidentally dropped something on the floor, and my usually careless cat's tail immediately poofs up because the loud noise startled him. Instead of being scared of me (as I caused the noise), he runs up to me meowing and starts headbutting / rubbing my legs. 
When I kneel down to pet and reassure him, he stands up on his hind legs to give me nose kisses.
My heart. 

He's also taken to laying on my arm for a big part of the day while I'm working behind my computer. Pretty sure he's a huge fan of the WFH / stay inside your house as much as possible situation.

edit: 'cause grammar is a thing"
"Reddit has taught me that if I could get over my social anxiety, I could do well in a public situation! It's sounds crazy but it's easier for me to talk to random strangers on the internet than to talk to a family member! Reddit had taught me that I'm not as horrible as I think I am! I have so many nice conversations with people everyday! Reddit has taught me that there is always someone to talk to, even if you don't always feel like you deserve it! 


Thank you people of reddit for being here!!"
"In our small apartment building there was the amazing hilarious beefy cat named Titty. And he wasn’t fat, he was BEEFY. He’d be laying on the stairs, completely taking up an entire step and you’d have to step over him with an armload of groceries.

We liked him so much sometimes we’d let him in our house and play with him and give him snackies. Due to his massiveness, he was SO clumsy. He had to be watched very closely because he’d accidentally knock items off of every surface he tried to jump onto. He almost knocked our TV down. 

Whenever it was time for him to leave, he’d go completely limp and we’d have to scrape him off the floor and literally lay him on the ground outside the door.

Once when I was going out, the door was be extra hard to push open and it was making a *draaaaagging* sound. Turns out Titty was just lounging right in front of our door and he didn’t give a fuck that it was smearing him across the ground.

It’s funny to think his owner had no idea that their cat had other human friends and would chill in their house."
"I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER. Yeah, there's shit being said about me behind my back and at my job. Whatever. I know what happened. I'm at peace. I realized for the first time in my life I had rose tinted glasses and couldn't see the red flags.

I'm free!


Here's to 2020, fuckers!

How's are you making this shitty year better for you?"
"It’s raining right now for the first time in the year where I live and I’m soo happy, I was so tired of seeing the sun every day.
That’s it, I just wanted to share that."
"I can rarely do any work if I'm not listening to music. I can't listen to podcasts or audio books, because then I have to pay attention to what they're saying. I love to listen to music while I work, but my usual preferred genres (metal, rock, rap) are usually either loud or have a lot of lyrics and I end up getting distracted by them. Ever since I switched to classical music, it's been amazing. I don't listen to it on my free time, but when I turn it on as I'm working, the music just fills my head, no lyrics to distract me, and I work like a machine. A few days ago I was working for a whole hour and it just flew by without me even noticing it. I highly recommend it if you have struggled with concentration"
"I felt silly buying a movie I saw a million times and even owned in the past, I think on VHS, ha ha.

But I just really wanted to see it and I'm glad I got it. 

Just realized I should go make some popcorn, too!"
"Not as in ""I'm asking you out"", but it's gotten so difficult pre planning dinners for the week without getting boringly repetitive. How do you keep your taste buds engaged?"
"I live alone and I’m in my late twenties so I’m more than capable of looking after myself and my apartment and paying my own way. While writing down the home wifi password in her notes for her to find I noticed a note titled “Things she would like” and some of the items that were listed were as follows;

- instapot, so she can make pho broth, (and make work lunches)
- new bike, for when she rides downtown on the weekends, helps her stay active (red or black)
- mentioned liking those coiled hair ties, good stocking stuffer maybe
- bring a couple gin bottle over the next time she invites us for dinner, she’s always running out  
- buy extra steaks for her from Costco, helps with her anemia and workouts 
- climbing shoes - where to buy?! Ask joe 

My heart hurt and I had to go to the bathroom and cry for a bit knowing that they were still trying to sneakily provide for me when they can. They had just brought me gin last weekend and definitely lied about how they’d just bought “too much” and didn’t have space for it in the cupboard. Guess you never really stop being a kid to them."
"I put a bed in my room for my dog a couple of days ago so he can sleep in it if he wants, I just lifted the pillow out the bottom and it seems this bed has been accumulating socks from all over the house. My brothers sock, my dads sock, my mums sock, my other brothers sock and my sock. Just one of each. He must have nabbed them when they were drying after being washed. This made me laugh a bit and I hope it made some people reading this laugh too."
"1. What are you lovely folks waiting for to arrive?

2. Do you have a favorite childhood memory?

3. Describe to me your ideal home 

4. Have you taken your mental health days?"
"I'm a high school coach and Economics teacher, and I feel so bad for all the graduating Seniors who have to miss out on the best six months of your lives (so far, hopefully). I'm the Senior class adviser and I love organizing all the Senior events at the end of the year. I hope you guys are finding ways to celebrate and enjoy your accomplishments with your family. 

I especially feel the pain of the Senior athletes in baseball, softball and track and field. There is nothing like seeing the results of all the hard work pay off with the best athletic year of your career (so far). I hope you guys continue your athletic career into college or at least stay active in intramural and/rec sports somehow.


Congratulations and best wishes, class of 2020."
While cleaning up my room I found my old ipod and it still works. I started listening to it and the song Animal by Neon Trees came up and idk why but I got really emotional. I have not heard that song since eighth grade nut hearing brought happiness to me for some reason. Anyone else ever felt that way?
"The past 29 years have been a roller coaster of ups and downs. But the feeling I always end up with.. The average feeling.. is isolation. The feeling is that no one gives a shit about each other. The amount of  empathy is abysmal. The more I give back here, the more I realize no one else is. I'm a second away from leaving and it makes me so sad. Why don't the people around me care about each other? I mean, not you, but the few hundred people I know are a pretty large cross section. Are there any other foreigners who feel this way? I'm so tired of the self-centeredness. In this crisis, people are doing things for each other. But only for those who they feel will reciprocate someday or for those they feel are like themselves somehow? it's confusing. And even here, I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion and people will tell me not to let the door hit me on the way out. And that's the problem. It's so sad."
"I'm trying to relax for bed but my brain is so overactive because I'm anxious about having another night terror like I did last night so I thought I'd try distracting it by learning some new trivia, so does anyone have any good facts?"
"As someone who hates hot and warm weather, the recent heat in my area is starting to kill me. I live in the inner East Bay and while the heat here isn't humid, summer temps are regularly 95-100 for weeks on end and heat is much worse when you're inside all day. Today was 95 and it's slowly starting to get higher I'm the following weeks. I cannot function in heat. I feel dizzy, I lose motivation to do anything, I get shaky, and my body and mental state does not I improve until I take my shower at night. On any other normal day, I don't have to deal with the heat much because I'm at work where it's air conditioned. 

I've been working from home for 2 months now and my mental state from being inside all day has already taken a toll on me. Now this heat is making it worse. I have to be working from home in this heat and I don't have access to the A/C controls. I rent out a room and I'm at the mercy of my landlords. They are generally ok and will turn it on as needed. But still, I just wish I didn't have to worry about which temperature I'll be most comfortable working in. I'm sure many of you who pay for your own electric bill will also now have to consider a higher bill since you'll be using you're A/C more. How are you guys making out so far?"
"It comes down to three groups of people. There's a group of old timers that get drunk and chain now people's yards, there's the next door neighbor who mows our lawn in recompense for her dog shitting in our yard who hates my husband and in-laws but seems to like me ok, and then there's my in-laws themselves who come over to mow. 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do in these scenarios so usually I just set beer on the deck with a wave but now we're out of beer and my in-laws are mowing the lawn right now and yelling at each other about who gets to use the new mower and I don't think we're supposed to interact due to quarantine and I have a huge zit outbreak so I'm officially hiding in the bathroom.

How do y'all handle humans and socializing? Sometimes I bring stuff from our orchard but otherwise I prefer to interact as little as possible with any living being. At least it's not the excommunicated Amish neighbors or the neighbors that got swatted in a drug bust but Jesus Christ quarantine had made me reverse even more into the negatives with my social skills."
Reddit I feel like we're dating and we just got to the point in the relationship where I feel comfortable making mistakes around you and farting in front of you. I'm so happy with you! Where are you at in your reddit relationship? Does anyone else feel this way?
"During the 10 years I've known my boyfriend, he always said he hated cats and found it very weird how I am very fond of them. Whenever I start to tell stories about my cats he would look unamused and say how cats aren't loyal or fun as dogs are.

We are in a country that has millions of strays and no shelters, so once I got a secure job I started rescuing cats and dogs that I find sick.

He was watching what I'm doing and sometimes giving me and the rescue a ride to the vet if he was off from work. Until last year, he found a cat on his doorstep that was malnourished. He let her inside and proceeded to ask me to come over and help give her a bath and take her to the vet. He decided to keep her as his mom loved her!

Fast forward a few months, he found an emaciated baby Persian kitten on the sidewalk and he took her without hesitation. He took her to the vet and nurtured her back to life. He has been telling me how he loves her so much and how he feels like she is his best buddy, and keeps sending me selfies of both of them cuddling before going to sleep.

Yesterday, he sent me pictures of a new persian cat that was probably dumped by her first home, she was right in front of his doorstep and wouldn't leave him. He took her in, gave her a bath, then flooded me with pictures and videos of the new cat sleeping on his chest and purring. We are taking her to the vet today to get her checked out! 

I think I did it! My boyfriend is a true cat person!"
"All I got to say is wow, I really loved it. The audio used from podcasts really meshed well with the animation. The animation itself was very trippy and interesting. The topics were also so profound and kept me hooked each episode. I know some people would just say that it’s a show for stoners or something but, coming from someone who’s not a stoner, this show is amazing. I’m so going to rewatch the whole thing again."
"It’s been about 2 months since quarantine started, and I have not picked up any new hobbies to keep me busy. I do the usual each day. I wake up, eat breakfast, and jump straight to homework or classes. When I have free time, I usually nap or scroll Reddit/Tik Tok for a good while. I’ve also been able to squeeze in a workout here and there. I just don’t know what else I can do that’ll keep me entertained. I’ve also been picking up a canvas and some acrylic paints lately. But even then, I get an art block where I don’t have motivation to paint since I don’t know what to paint. I just don’t want to waste anymore time since this is the only limited free time anyone will ever have."
"I feel like a nervous little kid again. To clarify I am 23 years old lol. I just had a tooth extracted a couple months ago so i’m not sure why i’m so nervous about this. I guess it’s the thought of have 4 deeply embedded teeth removed from my skull, and at least 2 of them are entangled in my nerve apparently. Also being put to sleep even though i’m thankful for the option. Wish me luck!"
"So most of this actually happened last year but I still fell like sharing this story. Also sorry long post!

Last year my fiance and I decided to surprise our friends we hadn't seen in the past year by showing up at their graduation. It was a 10+ hours drive but we were determined. So after a long day of taking finals for me and of working for my fiance we packed the car and we hit the road.  The first part of the trip went smoothly until 2:30AM. 

We are very very low on gas and pull up at a gas station in the middle of nowhere to fill up. Fiance's credit card gets denied over and over again, and I realize that  I must have forgotten mine back home. To make matters worse we did not have any cash on us. We were now stranded in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, with no money and no gas. By calling the bank emergency phone line we learned that his card had been deactivated because it had been hacked and used in another country. The only way to get another one was to wait for a bank nearby to open. We knew that at this point we would have no way to make it in time to our friend's graduation. We sat inside the gas station to wait it out.

After 30 or so minutes one of the gas station employee came to see us and asked us what was the problem. We explained the all thing, where we were from and where we were going and why. He nodded, left us for a minute and came back with his wallet. ""How much do you need to get there?"". We were dumbfounded and at first did not want to accept it. In the end he gave us $100 and told us to use it for gas to go see our friend's graduation. We offered to leave some of our valuables with him in exchange and that he could hold on to it until we came to pay him back. He refused. He didn't know us and still was more than willing to help us out.

We made it to our friends's graduation and had a great day with them (we haven't seen them in person since then because they moved all over the US and world). We got a new credit card. Before we left to go back to our place, we stopped at a Starbuck and the person before us had paid for our drink, it is a detail but still made our day. 

On our way back we, of course, stopped at that same gas station, and paid him back + some extras to thank him for what he did. This stranger, well the two of them because I can't forget about Starbuck stranger either, helped us or paid for something for us even though they did not know us and had nothing to gain in return. They've changed my view on things and had a way bigger impact on our lives that they can imagine. Faith in humanity restored. 

Well since then, we've been able to save a bit more money so we could start paying it forward too. Last weekend we helped a few people in need to buy some food and other first necessities. And yesterday we went to get ice cream at a drive-thru and paid for the couple behind us. Well they managed to follow us (that what we get for having a very recognizable car) and stopped to say thank you. It is such a small thing, but seeing their smiles on their faces was just amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway! Your turn now! Do any of you have strangers that have in some way or another changed your life, gave you that ""faith in humanity restored"" feeling or whom you simply cannot forget because of what they did for you?"
"I don’t know how much longer I can take living in the U.S. I’m legitimately scared of what i see everyday in the news, and I’m shocked that most of the people around me don’t notice the corruption/racism/blatant disregard for science and facts. I grew up very VERY conservative in a tiny backwoods town and I feel like I’m just waking up and noticing all of this myself, and I just want to get out. 

So, I’m asking you guys, where should I go?? I know nowhere I move to will be perfect but there’s GOT to be a better place than anywhere I will find here."
"I'm talking about, for example, there's 2 people left on The Bachelor (or a cooking show or any competition) and one of them says ""I've got a 50/50 shot of winning this thing."" Yeah, if the winner is determined by flipping a coin, you have a 50/50 shot. But since feelings/talent/public opinion come into play to determine the winner, the odds are not 50/50!"
"Does everyone in a group of friends have to have a useful purpose/duty. I don’t know what role I play however, I cannot handle many social obligations! Do you have different roles within different groups of friends?"
"Whether it’s an objective to be healthy, play sports, become doctors, get rich, give to charity, be musicians, be actors. Builders, etc., having an objective helps family cohesiveness. Doing anything together, even moving in the same general direction is something solid no matter what. 

The alternative is everyone just floats in a general area, and strong bonds aren’t created. I guess that’s ok I guess..."
" Hello everyone, I'm curious if anyone has any lovely stories of moving from your hometown? I've always lived within one hour of over a dozen family members and for most of my life, I've lived within 10 minutes of my parents. I've come to a point in my career where I'm very strongly considering moving into the next state over for a position I just applied to, and I'm mildly nervous to be starting on my own in a new place. I'm very excited about the job, but the thought of being in a new community and a new church and a new job makes me cautious. I'm sure there are benefits of being further from family such as a little more independence and self-reliance. Other than various moves from apartment to apartment within my hometown, I've never moved. I grew up in the same house from the day my parents brought me home until I got married. So if you have moving tips those are appreciated as well."
"Our ceremony was supposed to be on the 21st, but because of the Coronavirus they pushed the ceremony to July 21st. Originally it was supposed to be at a hockey arena in my city but now we're having it in the arena at the university I'm going to. Even though the ceremony got pushed back my family is gonna have a party for me before it happens. Don't tell anybody, but I'm hoping I get a lot of presents."
"i just got a really good deal on some pants.  i bought them on clearance from 'mark's work warehouse'.  i thought they were a good deal but had no idea just what a steal they were.  i payed like eight dollars each but didn't see what price they were regularly.  they just came in the mail today (free shipping too) and the tags on them were labeled with their original price: 49.99.  and they're actually worth the original price.  i'm on top of the world right now and have to tell everyone about the bargain i got.  and it's not even the price, it's the quality and the cut and the fact that i really needed new pants. 

every time i get a good deal, i'm just so full of myself and feel so smart and savvy even if it's something really small.  tbh it's the small sales that usually count.  not too many people seem to care if a two dollar item goes on sale for 75 cents but that's where the biggest sales usually are, percentage wise.  in short i'm a penny-pincher and proud of it.

does anyone else get smug with a good purchase?  can any of you remember the last deal you got?"
"Rate your day out of 5!

My day was a 4/5. Had a real good day at work, and spend my break with a bunch of colleagues enjoying the sunshine. Now at my parents' place to unwind a bit after a busy week. Get to sleep in tomorrow! :D

Tell me about your day!"
"Due to unforeseen circumstances due to the pandemic, I’m caring for my 14 yo SIL rn. She’s at a tough age. Got any ideas for good 2 person games appropriate for a 14 yo? She like singing, drawing, and is very smart overall."
"Granted, Fridays aren't what they used to be, but I'm still excited to be off the clock in a few hours. Thinking about picking up some Korean groceries afterwards and making a traditional Korean meal. Then excited to hop on zoom with my friends and playing games and getting tipsy with each other. 

What are you guys planning on doing later tongiht?"
"I've had this question on my mind for a long time and I don't really talk to people about this topic much but, what's your favorite band, and what genre is it??"
"My cat, Mr B., snuggled on my lap for about 10 minutes this morning while I was working from home. 

This may seem small and insignificant, but he came from an abusive owner and had one of his legs amputated due to it being so broken and mangled from their abuse. 

I adopted him 5 months ago and at first could only pet his head for about 10 seconds before he would bite me to let me know he was done. 

In the time since, he moved from sleeping on a chair to sleeping at the foot of my bed, letting me pick him up and give him scritches for short periods of time, and sitting next to me while I work or watch TV. 

He will sometimes come into my lap for only a few seconds before jumping off. Today he laid down, was purring, and totally peaceful as he stayed for 10 minutes! After which he pounced on my hand and bit me playfully (we still have some progress to make) but it was a big moment!"
"i randomly caved and bought a Nintendo switch lite. i haven't had an up to date console since my 360 became obsolete in 2013. 

i can't really afford this, what with everything being so uncertain right now, but I'm bored and i was feeling lonely and i think &lt;£200 in 7 years for a console that's probably going to be around for a while is okay, right?

also I'm probably not going to get animal crossing or Pokémon, but if anyone has any game suggestions, or ways to feel less bad about the spending, it's very welcome"
"I'm new to Reddit so I'm not exactly sure where to put this story, but I figured to just try it out. Obviously this is a bit of an older story since we can't go out to restaurants right now, but it's one of my favorites to talk about. So it was my birthday back in November and my sister decided to take me out for lunch. We went to our favorite place, a local diner that we go to all the time. Our favorite waitress there was working at the time so we were super happy. We find out that it was also her birthday and, since she's our favorite waitress, we leave her a 100% tip. We never really order expensive stuff, so the bill was only $20 about and we left her a $20 tip so it was nothing too crazy, but it made me really happy to be able to do that for her especially since her father had passed only a few weeks prior. Hopefully it made her day."
"Im a graduate student looking to take a gap year before applying to another graduate program. All my life I've just studied and gone to school, besides the usual non-paid internship, volunteering--you know, the stuff that toughens the resume while people take advantage of the fact you need the experience and don't pay you. 

This year, it's been the first time I've had to apply for jobs in the related field before applying to any other graduate programs. I never knew it hurt so much to get that rejection. I had too high of expectations since I had friends who worked there and have heard connections are just as important as resume and personality. I was honestly near tears when I received the email today. I usually expect the worse for most things in life. A part of me wishes I did the same for job seeking. 

Now, a couple of hours later, I'm back at the computer scanning for positions that may be open. Still super bummed and hurt, but gonna try to somehow turn this situation into fuel to fire up my motivation to search harder, longer."

"Heyo so names Garrett I'm 20. I've kinda only had one close friend for years. And that's my girlfriend. We've been together sense highschool and still are. But for a wile I've just thought I'd like to have more, spacificly male friends. 
My biggest hobbies are gaming, Tabletop Roleplaying (DND) and cooking honestly DnD is like my second job. I work at Kroger as a Lead for the pickup department, so I'm obviously pretty busy but I also DM DnD games on the weekends. I put alot of time effort and money into my games and it's one of the things I look forward most for every day. So with that and a girlfriend I stay busy enough to not worry about other things and I've just been coasting for a wile. 
To be clear I'm not introverted, I'm very friendly and good with people. I just don't make friends at work because I'm the boss kind of and I'm younger then alot of the people there. I think I've just been better at being nice and friendly to people as more of a stranger and I haven't worked on making lasting connections because I've got everything I really need.
So yeah I play PS4 and DND and I'm looking for people who are interested in the things I am and want to have discussions about them."
"Curious how you guys keep yourself motivated during all this. Writing to-do list everyday really keeps you on track, but what are some other ways that help you keep up with everything?"
"I just got back into hobby crafting, and got some inspiration to make my own resin dice.

After doing some reading and watching instructional videos, I got some stuff together and I'm starting to make some molds. 

I'm currently letting my first mold cure, so I'm super excited to see how it turned out so I can keep making more. Soon I'll have enough molds for an entire set!"
"Around half the time I speak to a new person, they point out that my voice was NOT what they were expecting and it's slowly getting old.

I'm 19, 5'7 and 120 lbs. My babyface is not helping (I look around 14) and I can't grow a beard but I also have a deep bass voice which my friends say would fit a 40 year old better. 

I'm also thinking about getting into voice acting but I'm not sure yet.

Can't wait until I can grow a beard!"
"I've been watching a ton of videos from Kitboga on YouTube. If you haven't heard of Kitboga, he is a savvy guy who likes to string tech scammers along. The idea is that every hour they spend with him is an hour they can't spend taking advantage of someone else. The content is good, but he uses a voice changer to create this characters, and I've gotten pretty attached to the elderly woman he's created. Like, I would like to go visit her and chat, but she isn't real haha. I'm sure that's happened to you guys before with books and shows. Who would you like to sit down with if you coudl?"
Hey everyone- usually turning 30 makes people trip out. This year is especially rough. It feels like I have a doomsday countdown. Anyone else feeling this way?
"I've been playing with a couple of personal projects since I started staying at home, and one of those is comedy. I've been watching interview after interview with comedians, and one that stuck out was [Nick Guerra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMiMk3OUphk). He said he writes page after page, organizing his set-list, ultimately to make sure he has a beginning and end. It really gave me a sense of relief to know that even the more seasoned comedians still do those mental gymnastics, and it's not just the newbies. Anyone else working on some fun new projects with their time at home?"
"I just read Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet, as well as being an excellent read I learned a lot about this period in history and a heck of a lot about cathedrals!

I’d love to hear if you have any fiction you’d recommend that also taught you something new a long the way

 (less *taught me to love* and more “taught me about the civil rights movement” sort of learning)"
"When the world was normal, I was always in the dark. No motivation, hopelessness. 

But when the world is now on lockdown, I suddenly have this weird will to live, to eat healthy, to lose weight and to get better. I am currently on a diet, and yesterday I sorta exercised in my room. Both, I rarely do. 

So today, I'm gonna work out again, in my room. 

This whole thing...is weird. I wonder WHY in the world, do we suddenly want to change ourselves when the world is ending.."
"So because of quarantine and health concerns, this weekend’s Mother’s Day will be completely different than years past. No brunches, no gatherings or visits, blah blah blah. 

I don’t have the best relationship with my mom, but I do get her 💐 on occasions like this. 
I’m thinking of just getting her a Target gift card this year so she can shop for toiletries/personal items etc. 

Seems like my $ will go further that way and she’ll benefit adequately too. What do you peeps think?"
"Well for the past few weeks I've been getting it a few times a week. I'm not sure how common it is but it's where you're awake mentally but your body is still physically asleep so you can't move a muscle like you're paralysed. Also because you're still half asleep you will be guaranteed to hallucinate and hear sounds. 

Anyone else get it? What's your experience with it?"
"Sitting here on a beautiful spring morning while the world
outside goes to hell in a hand basket. The amazing aroma 
of an apple pie my wife is baking is permeating the room.
Such juxtapositions, that is all."
Just wanted to say hello and see how you’re all doing during this quarantine and what you’re doing to stay sane or try to stay sane at least.
"I am going to start my first job soon, that is, if I manage to graduate this year due to the lockdown. Our country doesn't have a culture of doing jobs while at school. So I'm pretty nervous and was just wondering how your first job experiences were like???"
"I had a lot of personality issues. I did not really grow up in a mentally healthy environment, which led me to always look for love. I was always hoping for people to like me. I was kind of a Coward. I never felt like a normal person. During quarantine, I decided to work on myself. I have started to exercise and read. I have also started a journal to write how I feel. The change has begun. I am not going to let my past ruin my future. If there is anyone else with such issues out there; You got this and you don't need someone else to tell that to you."
"Who in your life do you love despite the fact that you have different perspectives?

My dad and I disagree on just about everything: politics and religion to name a few. 

Perhaps it is COVID lockdown that has granted me a new lens of love, acceptance, and tolerance. Perhaps I’ve always just been this way. Who knows? 

Despite our differences, I’m always going to love that crusty ol’ asshole. He’s always gonna be my dad and I’m always gonna be his little girl no matter how much the years have aged us both. 

He’s on his way down to see me as I type. I’m so excited to see him, give him a hug in real life, and let him know that I love him. 

...and I’m also really glad that I no longer have cable so I don’t have to suffer through 24/7 of his extremely skewed news channel... 😂🤣😂"
"Natural yoghurt. Wanted to know my limits. When I was a kid I was a dairy fiend, I'd drink cream if it was there, and milk never lasted long. Yoghurt was a bit more expensive, so when my housemate challenged me I just did what any hero would do. Pretty excited to see what's gonna happen later."
"This has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I have not been sure how to put it into words.

With the large number of people protesting the stay at home orders, it just shows what kind of people we live with. I don't want to single anyone out, but it, to me, looks like the type of people who tell you that you should follow the rules but when it affects them it becomes a problem. I get it, but at the same time, I do not. People are bringing guns to these events and that scares me because you never know what kind of psycho are at these events. 

Now you are getting people who don't understand things are closed for a reason. Like today, some lady shot 3 people at a McDonald's. Why? Because the sitting area was closed. How about when that security guard got shot because someone didn't want to wear a mask? That is scary because it feels like it could be anyone who would shoot someone for not wanting to wear a mask. 

It feels like the whole US is angry and there is nothing anyone can do to fix it."
